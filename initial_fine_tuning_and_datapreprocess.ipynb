It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues but it is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Neither losartan nor its principal active metabolite exhibits any partial agonist activity at the AT 1 receptor, and both have much greater affinity (about 1000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. The active metabolite is 10 to 40 times more potent by weight than losartan and appears to be a reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kininase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin), nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Losartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II (as well as angiotensin I) infusions. A dose of 100 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 85% at peak with 25 to 40% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a doubling to tripling in plasma renin activity and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Losartan does not affect the response to bradykinin, whereas ACE inhibitors increase the response to bradykinin. Aldosterone plasma concentrations fall following losartan administration. In spite of the effect of losartan on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. The effect of losartan is substantially present within one week but in some studies the maximal effect occurred in 3 to 6 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies (without placebo control) the effect of losartan appeared to be maintained for up to a year. There is no apparent rebound effect after abrupt withdrawal of losartan. There was essentially no change in average heart rate in losartan-treated patients in controlled trials. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Following oral administration, losartan is well absorbed and undergoes substantial first-pass metabolism. The systemic bioavailability of losartan is approximately 33%. Mean peak concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are reached in 1 hour and in 3 to 4 hours, respectively. While maximum plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are approximately equal, the AUC (area under the curve) of the metabolite is about 4 times as great as that of losartan. A meal slows absorption of losartan and decreases its Cmax but has only minor effects on losartan AUC or on the AUC of the metabolite (~10% decrease). The pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite are linear with oral losartan doses up to 200 mg and do not change over time. Distribution: The volume of distribution of losartan and the active metabolite is about 34 liters and 12 liters, respectively. Both losartan and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin, with plasma free fractions of 1.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range achieved with recommended doses. Studies in rats indicate that losartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. Metabolism: Losartan is an orally active agent that undergoes substantial first-pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is converted, in part, to an active carboxylic acid metabolite that is responsible for most of the angiotensin II receptor antagonism that follows losartan treatment. About 14% of an orally-administered dose of losartan is converted to the active metabolite. In addition to the active carboxylic acid metabolite, several inactive metabolites are formed. In vitro studies indicate that cytochrome P450 2C9 and 3A4 are involved in the biotransformation of losartan to its metabolites. Elimination: Total plasma clearance of losartan and the active metabolite is about 600 mL/min and 50 mL/min, respectively, with renal clearance of about 75 mL/min and 25 mL/min, respectively. The terminal half-life of losartan is about 2 hours and of the metabolite is about 6 to 9 hours. After single doses of losartan administered orally, about 4% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and about 6% is excreted in urine as active metabolite. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of losartan and its metabolites. Following oral 14 C-labeled losartan, about 35% of radioactivity is recovered in the urine and about 60% in the feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled losartan, about 45% of radioactivity is recovered in the urine and 50% in the feces. Neither losartan nor its metabolite accumulates in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. Special Populations Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple doses of losartan (average dose 0.7 mg/kg, range 0.36 to 0.97 mg/kg) as a tablet to 25 hypertensive patients aged 6 to 16 years are shown in Table 4 below. Pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite were generally similar across the studied age groups and similar to historical pharmacokinetic data in adults. The principal pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and children are shown in the table below. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Hypertensive Adults and Children Age 6 to 16 Following Multiple Dosing Adults given 50 mg once daily for 7 days N=12 Age 6-16 given 0.7 mg/kg once daily for 7 days N=25 Parent Active Metabolite Parent Active Metabolite AUC 0-24 (ng\\u2022hr/mL) * 442\\u00b1173 1685\\u00b1452 368\\u00b1169 1866\\u00b11076 C MAX (ng/mL) * 224\\u00b182 212\\u00b173 141\\u00b188 222\\u00b1127 T 1/2 (h) \\u2020 2.1\\u00b10.70 7.4\\u00b12.4 2.3\\u00b10.8 5.6\\u00b11.2 T PEAK (h) \\u2021 0.9 3.5 2 4.1 CL REN (mL/min) * 56\\u00b123 20\\u00b13 53\\u00b133 17\\u00b18 *Mean \\u00b1 standard deviation \\u2020Harmonic mean and standard deviation \\u2021Median The bioavailability of the suspension formulation was compared with losartan tablets in healthy adults. The suspension and tablet are similar in their bioavailability with respect to both losartan and the active metabolite [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Geriatric and Gender: Losartan pharmacokinetics have been investigated in the elderly (65 to 75 years) and in both genders. Plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are similar in elderly and young hypertensives. Plasma concentrations of losartan were about twice as high in female hypertensives as male hypertensives, but concentrations of the active metabolite were similar in males and females. No dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Race : Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Renal Insufficiency : Following oral administration, plasma concentrations and AUCs of losartan and its active metabolite are increased by 50 to 90% in patients with mild (creatinine clearance of 50 to 74 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 49 mL/min) renal insufficiency. In this study, renal clearance was reduced by 55 to 85% for both losartan and its active metabolite in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency. Neither losartan nor its active metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Hepatic Insufficiency: Following oral administration in patients with mild to moderate alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite were, respectively, 5-times and about 1.7-times those in young male volunteers. Compared to normal subjects the total plasma clearance of losartan in patients with hepatic insufficiency was about 50% lower and the oral bioavailability was about doubled. Use a starting dose of 25 mg for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Losartan potassium has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )]. Drug Interactions No clinically significant drug interactions have been found in studies of losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, cimetidine and phenobarbital. However, rifampin has been shown to decrease the AUC of losartan and its active metabolite by 30% and 40%, respectively. Fluconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C9, decreased the AUC of the active metabolite by approximately 40%, but increased the AUC of losartan by approximately 70% following multiple doses. Conversion of losartan to its active metabolite after intravenous administration is not affected by ketoconazole, an inhibitor of P450 3A4. The AUC of active metabolite following oral losartan was not affected by erythromycin, an inhibitor of P450 3A4, but the AUC of losartan was increased by 30%. The pharmacodynamic consequences of concomitant use of losartan and inhibitors of P450 2C9 have not been examined. Subjects who do not metabolize losartan to active metabolite have been shown to have a specific, rare defect in cytochrome P450 2C9. These data suggest that the conversion of losartan to its active metabolite is mediated primarily by P450 2C9 and not P450 3A4.\"\n",

Elimination: Total plasma clearance of losartan and the active metabolite is about 600 mL/min and 50 mL/min, respectively, with renal clearance of about 75 mL/min and 25 mL/min, respectively. The terminal half-life of losartan is about 2 hours and of the metabolite is about 6 to 9 hours. After single doses of losartan administered orally, about 4% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and about 6% is excreted in urine as active metabolite. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of losartan and its metabolites. Following oral 14 C-labeled losartan, about 35% of radioactivity is recovered in the urine and about 60% in the feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled losartan, about 45% of radioactivity is recovered in the urine and 50% in the feces. Neither losartan nor its metabolite accumulates in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. Special Populations Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple doses of losartan (average dose 0.7 mg/kg, range 0.36 to 0.97 mg/kg) as a tablet to 25 hypertensive patients aged 6 to 16 years are shown in Table 4 below. Pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite were generally similar across the studied age groups and similar to historical pharmacokinetic data in adults. The principal pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and children are shown in the table below.

The suspension and tablet are similar in their bioavailability with respect to both losartan and the active metabolite [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Geriatric and Gender: Losartan pharmacokinetics have been investigated in the elderly (65 to 75 years) and in both genders. Plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are similar in elderly and young hypertensives. Plasma concentrations of losartan were about twice as high in female hypertensives as male hypertensives, but concentrations of the active metabolite were similar in males and females. No dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Race : Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Renal Insufficiency : Following oral administration, plasma concentrations and AUCs of losartan and its active metabolite are increased by 50 to 90% in patients with mild (creatinine clearance of 50 to 74 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 49 mL/min) renal insufficiency. In this study, renal clearance was reduced by 55 to 85% for both losartan and its active metabolite in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency. Neither losartan nor its active metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Hepatic Insufficiency: Following oral administration in patients with mild to moderate alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite were, respectively, 5-times and about 1.7-times those in young male volunteers. Compared to normal subjects the total plasma clearance of losartan in patients with hepatic insufficiency was about 50% lower and the oral bioavailability was about doubled. Use a starting dose of 25 mg for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Losartan potassium has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )]. Drug Interactions No clinically significant drug interactions have been found in studies of losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, cimetidine and phenobarbital. However, rifampin has been shown to decrease the AUC of losartan and its active metabolite by 30% and 40%, respectively. Fluconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C9, decreased the AUC of the active metabolite by approximately 40%, but increased the AUC of losartan by approximately 70% following multiple doses. Conversion of losartan to its active metabolite after intravenous administration is not affected by ketoconazole, an inhibitor of P450 3A4. The AUC of active metabolite following oral losartan was not affected by erythromycin, an inhibitor of P450 3A4, but the AUC of losartan was increased by 30%. The pharmacodynamic consequences of concomitant use of losartan and inhibitors of P450 2C9 have not been examined. Subjects who do not metabolize losartan to active metabolite have been shown to have a specific, rare defect in cytochrome P450 2C9. These data suggest that the conversion of losartan to its active metabolite is mediated primarily by P450 2C9 and not P450 3A4.\"\n",

Female rats given the highest dose (270 mg/kg/day) had a slightly higher incidence of pancreatic acinar adenoma. The maximally tolerated dosages (270 mg/kg/day in rats, 200 mg/kg/day in mice) provided systemic exposures for losartan and its pharmacologically active metabolite that were approximately 160 and 90 times (rats) and 30 and 15 times (mice) the exposure of a 50 kg human given 100 mg per day. Losartan potassium was negative in the microbial mutagenesis and V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assays and in the in vitro alkaline elution and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration assays. In addition, the active metabolite showed no evidence of genotoxicity in the microbial mutagenesis, in vitro alkaline elution, and in vitro chromosomal aberration assays. Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male rats given oral doses of losartan potassium up to approximately 150 mg/kg/day. The administration of toxic dosage levels in females (300/200 mg/kg/day) was associated with a significant (p<0.05) decrease in the number of corpora lutea/female, implants/female, and live fetuses/female at C-section. At 100 mg/kg/day only a decrease in the number of corpora lutea/female was observed. The relationship of these findings to drug- treatment is uncertain since there was no effect at these dosage levels on implants/pregnant female, percent post-implantation loss, or live animals/litter at parturition. In nonpregnant rats dosed at 135 mg/kg/day for 7 days, systemic exposure (AUCs) for losartan and its active metabolite were approximately 66 and 26 times the exposure achieved in man at the maximum recommended human daily dosage (100 mg).\"\n",

            "        \"14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult Hypertension The antihypertensive effects of losartan potassium were demonstrated principally in 4 placebo-controlled, 6- to 12-\\u00ad week trials of dosages from 10 to 150 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 115. The studies allowed comparisons of two doses (50 to 100 mg/day) as once-daily or twice-daily regimens, comparisons of peak and trough effects, and comparisons of response by gender, age, and race. Three additional studies examined the antihypertensive effects of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination. The 4 studies of losartan monotherapy included a total of 1075 patients randomized to several doses of losartan and 334 to placebo. The 10- and 25-mg doses produced some effect at peak (6 hours after dosing) but small and inconsistent trough (24 hour) responses. Doses of 50, 100 and 150 mg once daily gave statistically significant systolic/diastolic mean decreases in blood pressure, compared to placebo in the range of 5.5 to 10.5/3.5 to 7.5 mmHg, with the 150-mg dose giving no greater effect than 50 to 100 mg. Twice-daily dosing at 50 to 100 mg/day gave consistently larger trough responses than once-daily dosing at the same total dose. Peak (6 hour) effects were uniformly, but moderately, larger than trough effects, with the trough-to-peak ratio for systolic and diastolic responses 50 to 95% and 60 to 90%, respectively. Addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to losartan 50 mg once daily resulted in placebo- adjusted blood pressure reductions of 15.5/9.2 mmHg. Analysis of age, gender, and race subgroups of patients showed that men and women, and patients over and under 65, had generally similar responses. losartan potassium was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in Black patients (usually a low-renin population). Pediatric Hypertension The antihypertensive effect of losartan was studied in one trial enrolling 177 hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years old. Children who weighed <50 kg received 2.5, 25 or 50 mg of losartan daily and patients who weighed \\u226550 kg received 5, 50 or 100 mg of losartan daily. Children in the lowest dose group were given losartan in a suspension formulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. The majority of the children had hypertension associated with renal and urogenital disease. The sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) on entry into the study was higher than the 95 th percentile level for the patient's age, gender, and height. At the end of three weeks, losartan reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured at trough, in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, the two higher doses (25 to 50 mg in patients <50 kg; 50 to 100 mg in patients \\u226550 kg) reduced diastolic blood pressure by 5 to 6 mmHg more than the lowest dose used (2.5 mg in patients <50 kg; 5 mg in patients \\u226550 kg). The lowest dose, corresponding to an average daily dose of 0.07 mg/kg, did not appear to offer consistent antihypertensive efficacy. When patients were randomized to continue losartan at the two higher doses or to placebo after 3 weeks of therapy, trough diastolic blood pressure rose in patients on placebo between 5 and 7 mmHg more than patients randomized to continuing losartan. When the low dose of losartan was randomly withdrawn, the rise in trough diastolic blood pressure was the same in patients receiving placebo and in those continuing losartan, again suggesting that the lowest dose did not have significant antihypertensive efficacy. Overall, no significant differences in the overall antihypertensive effect of losartan were detected when the patients were analyzed according to age (<, \\u226512 years old) or gender. While blood pressure was reduced in all racial subgroups examined, too few non-White patients were enrolled to compare the dose-response of losartan in the non-White subgroup.\"\n",

( 1 ) Tizanidine tablets are indicated for the management of spasticity.

            "        \"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 , 12.3 ) To discontinue tizanidine tablets, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine tablets may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine tablet peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine tablets should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ].\"\n",

Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \\u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [ see Drug Interactions (7.5 , 7.6 )]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].\"\n",

The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Liver Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Sedation [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [ see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [ see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 a2-Adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \\u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].\"\n",

In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 mg/kg/day and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Impaired Hepatic Function The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.

Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis.

Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose.

            "        \"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences Between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 mg to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5 )]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. figure\"\n",

            "        \"12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences Between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 mg to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.

Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study-Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \\u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines. Tizanidine Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

Plasma cefdinir concentrations increase with dose, but the increases are less than dose-proportional from 300 mg (7 mg/kg) to 600 mg (14 mg/kg). Following administration of suspension to healthy adults, cefdinir bioavailability is 120% relative to capsules. Estimated bioavailability of cefdinir capsules is 21% following administration of a 300 mg capsule dose, and 16% following administration of a 600 mg capsule dose. Estimated absolute bioavailability of cefdinir suspension is 25%. Cefdinir oral suspension of 250 mg/5 mL strength was shown to be bioequivalent to the 125 mg/5 mL strength in healthy adults under fasting conditions. Effect of Food The C max and AUC of cefdinir from the capsules are reduced by 16% and 10%, respectively, when given with a high-fat meal. In adults given the 250 mg/5 mL oral suspension with a high-fat meal, the C max and AUC of cefdinir are reduced by 44% and 33%, respectively. The magnitude of these reductions is not likely to be clinically significant because the safety and efficacy studies of oral suspension in pediatric patients were conducted without regard to food intake. Therefore, cefdinir may be taken without regard to food.

Sinus Tissue In adult patients undergoing elective maxillary and ethmoid sinus surgery, respective median sinus tissue cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were <0.12 (<0.12 to 0.46) and 0.21 (<0.12 to 2) mcg/g. Mean sinus tissue concentrations were 16% (\\u00b120) of corresponding plasma concentrations. Lung Tissue In adult patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy, respective median bronchial mucosa cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were 0.78 (<0.06 to 1.33) and 1.14 (<0.06 to 1.92) mcg/mL, and were 31% (\\u00b118) of corresponding plasma concentrations. Respective median epithelial lining fluid concentrations were 0.29 (<0.3 to 4.73) and 0.49 (<0.3 to 0.59) mcg/mL, and were 35% (\\u00b183) of corresponding plasma concentrations. Middle Ear Fluid In 14 pediatric patients with acute bacterial otitis media, respective median middle ear fluid cefdinir concentrations 3 hours after administration of single 7 and 14 mg/kg doses were 0.21 (<0.09 to 0.94) and 0.72 (0.14 to 1.42) mcg/mL. Mean middle ear fluid concentrations were 15% (\\u00b115) of corresponding plasma concentrations. CSF Data on cefdinir penetration into human cerebrospinal fluid are not available. Metabolism and Excretion Cefdinir is not appreciably metabolized. Activity is primarily due to parent drug. Cefdinir is eliminated principally via renal excretion with a mean plasma elimination half-life (t \\u00bd ) of 1.7 (\\u00b10.6) hours. In healthy subjects with normal renal function, renal clearance is 2 (\\u00b11) mL/min/kg, and apparent oral clearance is 11.6 (\\u00b16) and 15.5 (\\u00b15.4) mL/min/kg following doses of 300 and 600 mg, respectively. Mean percent of dose recovered unchanged in the urine following 300 and 600 mg doses is 18.4% (\\u00b16.4) and 11.6% (\\u00b14.6), respectively. Cefdinir clearance is reduced in patients with renal dysfunction (see Special Populations : Patients with Renal Insufficiency ). Because renal excretion is the predominant pathway of elimination, dosage should be adjusted in patients with markedly compromised renal function or who are undergoing hemodialysis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Special Populations Patients with Renal Insufficiency Cefdinir pharmacokinetics were investigated in 21 adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Decreases in cefdinir elimination rate, apparent oral clearance (CL/F), and renal clearance were approximately proportional to the reduction in creatinine clearance (CL cr ). As a result, plasma cefdinir concentrations were higher and persisted longer in subjects with renal impairment than in those without renal impairment. In subjects with CL cr between 30 and 60 mL/min, C max and t \\u00bd increased by approximately 2-fold and AUC by approximately 3-fold. In subjects with CL cr <30 mL/min, C max increased by approximately 2-fold, t \\u00bd by approximately 5-fold, and AUC by approximately 6-fold. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with markedly compromised renal function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min; see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hemodialysis Cefdinir pharmacokinetics were studied in 8 adult subjects undergoing hemodialysis. Dialysis (4 hours duration) removed 63% of cefdinir from the body and reduced apparent elimination t \\u00bd from 16 (\\u00b13.5) to 3.2 (\\u00b11.2) hours. Dosage adjustment is recommended in this patient population (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Disease Because cefdinir is predominantly renally eliminated and not appreciably metabolized, studies in patients with hepatic impairment were not conducted. It is not expected that dosage adjustment will be required in this population. Geriatric Patients The effect of age on cefdinir pharmacokinetics after a single 300 mg dose was evaluated in 32 subjects 19 to 91 years of age. Systemic exposure to cefdinir was substantially increased in older subjects (N=16), C max by 44% and AUC by 86%. This increase was due to a reduction in cefdinir clearance. The apparent volume of distribution was also reduced, thus no appreciable alterations in apparent elimination t \\u00bd were observed (elderly: 2.2 \\u00b1 0.6 hours vs young: 1.8 \\u00b1 0.4 hours). Since cefdinir clearance has been shown to be primarily related to changes in renal function rather than age, elderly patients do not require dosage adjustment unless they have markedly compromised renal function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, see Patients with Renal Insufficiency , above). Gender and Race The results of a meta-analysis of clinical pharmacokinetics (N=217) indicated no significant impact of either gender or race on cefdinir pharmacokinetics. Microbiology Mechanism of Action As with other cephalosporins, bactericidal activity of cefdinir results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Cefdinir is stable in the presence of some, but not all, \\u03b2-lactamase enzymes. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins are susceptible to cefdinir. Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to cefdinir is primarily through hydrolysis by some \\u03b2-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and decreased permeability. Cefdinir is inactive against most strains of Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus spp., penicillin-resistant streptococci, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. \\u03b2-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae strains are typically non-susceptible to cefdinir. Antimicrobial Activity Cefdinir has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in INDICATIONS AND USAGE . Gram-Positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains only) Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-Negative Bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Haemophilus parainfluenzae Moraxella catarrhalis The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Cefdinir exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1 mcg/mL or less against (\\u226590%) strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of cefdinir in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-Positive Bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible strains only) Streptococcus agalactiae Viridans group streptococci Gram-Negative Bacteria Citrobacter koseri Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC .\"\n",

            "        \"Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism Absorption Oral Bioavailability Maximal plasma cefdinir concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours postdose following capsule or suspension administration. Plasma cefdinir concentrations increase with dose, but the increases are less than dose-proportional from 300 mg (7 mg/kg) to 600 mg (14 mg/kg). Following administration of suspension to healthy adults, cefdinir bioavailability is 120% relative to capsules. Estimated bioavailability of cefdinir capsules is 21% following administration of a 300 mg capsule dose, and 16% following administration of a 600 mg capsule dose. Estimated absolute bioavailability of cefdinir suspension is 25%. Cefdinir oral suspension of 250 mg/5 mL strength was shown to be bioequivalent to the 125 mg/5 mL strength in healthy adults under fasting conditions. Effect of Food The C max and AUC of cefdinir from the capsules are reduced by 16% and 10%, respectively, when given with a high-fat meal. In adults given the 250 mg/5 mL oral suspension with a high-fat meal, the C max and AUC of cefdinir are reduced by 44% and 33%, respectively. The magnitude of these reductions is not likely to be clinically significant because the safety and efficacy studies of oral suspension in pediatric patients were conducted without regard to food intake. Therefore, cefdinir may be taken without regard to food. Cefdinir Capsules Cefdinir plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameter values following administration of single 300 and 600 mg oral doses of cefdinir to adult subjects are presented in the following table: Mean (\\u00b1SD) Plasma Cefdinir Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values Following Administration of Capsules to Adult Subjects Dose C max (mcg/mL) t max (hr) AUC (mcg\\u2022hr/mL) 300 mg 1.6 (0.55) 2.9 (0.89) 7.05 (2.17) 600 mg 2.87 (1.01) 3 (0.66) 11.1 (3.87) Cefdinir Suspension Cefdinir plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameter values following administration of single 7 and 14 mg/kg oral doses of cefdinir to pediatric subjects (age 6 months to 12 years) are presented in the following table: Mean (\\u00b1SD) Plasma Cefdinir Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values Following Administration of Suspension to Pediatric Subjects Dose C max (mcg/mL) t max (hr) AUC (mcg\\u2022hr/mL) 7 mg/kg 2.3 (0.65) 2.2 (0.6) 8.31 (2.5) 14 mg/kg 3.86 (0.62) 1.8 (0.4) 13.4 (2.64) Multiple Dosing Cefdinir does not accumulate in plasma following once- or twice-daily administration to subjects with normal renal function. Distribution The mean volume of distribution (Vd area ) of cefdinir in adult subjects is 0.35 L/kg (\\u00b10.29); in pediatric subjects (age 6 months to 12 years), cefdinir Vd area is 0.67 L/kg (\\u00b10.38). Cefdinir is 60% to 70% bound to plasma proteins in both adult and pediatric subjects; binding is independent of concentration. Skin Blister In adult subjects, median (range) maximal blister fluid cefdinir concentrations of 0.65 (0.33 to 1.1) and 1.1 (0.49 to 1.9) mcg/mL were observed 4 to 5 hours following administration of 300 and 600 mg doses, respectively.

Mean middle ear fluid concentrations were 15% (\\u00b115) of corresponding plasma concentrations. CSF Data on cefdinir penetration into human cerebrospinal fluid are not available. Metabolism and Excretion Cefdinir is not appreciably metabolized. Activity is primarily due to parent drug. Cefdinir is eliminated principally via renal excretion with a mean plasma elimination half-life (t \\u00bd ) of 1.7 (\\u00b10.6) hours.

IF CEFDINIR IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG \\u03b2-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFDINIR OCCURS, THE DRUG SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefdinir, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.\"\n",

            "        \"PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing cefdinir in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. As with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged treatment may result in the possible emergence and overgrowth of resistant organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate alternative therapy should be administered. Cefdinir, as with other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (antibiotics), should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of colitis. In patients with transient or persistent renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), the total daily dose of cefdinir should be reduced because high and prolonged plasma concentrations of cefdinir can result following recommended doses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including cefdinir should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefdinir is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefdinir or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Antacids containing magnesium or aluminum interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If this type of antacid is required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the antacid. Iron supplements, including multivitamins that contain iron, interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement. Iron-fortified infant formula does not significantly interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Antacids (aluminum- or magnesium-containing) Concomitant administration of 300 mg cefdinir capsules with 30 mL Maalox \\u00ae TC suspension reduces the rate (C max ) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%. Time to reach C max is also prolonged by 1 hour. There are no significant effects on cefdinir pharmacokinetics if the antacid is administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after cefdinir. If antacids are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the antacid. Probenecid As with other \\u03b2-lactam antibiotics, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of cefdinir, resulting in an approximate doubling in AUC, a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination t \\u00bd . Iron Supplements and Foods Fortified With Iron Concomitant administration of cefdinir with a therapeutic iron supplement containing 60 mg of elemental iron (as FeSO 4 ) or vitamins supplemented with 10 mg of elemental iron reduced extent of absorption by 80% and 31%, respectively. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement. The effect of foods highly fortified with elemental iron (primarily iron-fortified breakfast cereals) on cefdinir absorption has not been studied. Concomitantly administered iron-fortified infant formula (2.2 mg elemental iron/6 oz) has no significant effect on cefdinir pharmacokinetics. There have been reports of reddish stools in patients receiving cefdinir. In many cases, patients were also receiving iron-containing products. The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between cefdinir or its breakdown products and iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using nitroprusside, but not with those using nitroferricyanide. The administration of cefdinir may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in urine using Clinitest \\u00ae , Benedict\\u2019s solution, or Fehling\\u2019s solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix \\u00ae or Tes-Tape \\u00ae ) be used. Cephalosporins are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs\\u2019 test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of cefdinir has not been evaluated. No mutagenic effects were seen in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) or point mutation assay at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus (HGPRT) in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells. No clastogenic effects were observed in vitro in the structural chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells or in vivo in the micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow. In rats, fertility and reproductive performance were not affected by cefdinir at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (70 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 11 times based on mg/m 2 /day). Pregnancy - Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Cefdinir was not teratogenic in rats at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (70 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 11 times based on mg/m 2 /day) or in rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 0.23 times based on mg/m 2 /day). Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain) was observed in rabbits at the maximum tolerated dose of 10 mg/kg/day without adverse effects on offspring. Decreased body weight occurred in rat fetuses at \\u2265100 mg/kg/day, and in rat offspring at \\u226532 mg/kg/day. No effects were observed on maternal reproductive parameters or offspring survival, development, behavior, or reproductive function. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Cefdinir has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Nursing Mothers Following administration of single 600 mg doses, cefdinir was not detected in human breast milk. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in neonates and infants less than 6 months of age have not been established. Use of cefdinir for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis in pediatric patients (age 6 months through 12 years) is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and adolescents, the similar pathophysiology of acute sinusitis in adult and pediatric patients, and comparative pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population. Geriatric Use Efficacy is comparable in geriatric patients and younger adults. While cefdinir has been well-tolerated in all age groups, in clinical trials geriatric patients experienced a lower rate of adverse events, including diarrhea, than younger adults. Dose adjustment in elderly patients is not necessary unless renal function is markedly compromised (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).\"\n",

Toxic signs and symptoms following overdosage with other \\u03b2-lactam antibiotics have included nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, and convulsions.

            "        \"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE for Indicated Pathogens) The recommended dosage and duration of treatment for infections in adults and adolescents are described in the following chart; the total daily dose for all infections is 600 mg. Once-daily dosing for 10 days is as effective as BID dosing. Once-daily dosing has not been studied in pneumonia or skin infections; therefore, cefdinir capsules should be administered twice daily in these infections. Cefdinir capsules may be taken without regard to meals. Adults and Adolescents (Age 13 Years and Older) Type of Infection Dosage Duration Community-Acquired Pneumonia 300 mg q12h 10 days Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis 300 mg q12h or 600 mg q24h 5 to 10 days 10 days Acute Maxillary Sinusitis 300 mg q12h or 600 mg q24h 10 days 10 days Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis 300 mg q12h or 600 mg q24h 5 to 10 days 10 days Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections 300 mg q12h 10 days Patients With Renal Insufficiency For adult patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, the dose of cefdinir should be 300 mg given once daily. Creatinine clearance is difficult to measure in outpatients. However, the following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance (CL cr ) in adult patients. For estimates to be valid, serum creatinine levels should reflect steady-state levels of renal function. Males: CL cr = (weight) (140 \\u2013 age) (72) (serum creatinine) Females: CL cr = 0.85 x above value where creatinine clearance is in mL/min, age is in years, weight is in kilograms, and serum creatinine is in mg/dL. 1 The following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance in pediatric patients: CL cr = K x body length or height serum creatinine where K=0.55 for pediatric patients older than 1 year 2 and 0.45 for infants (up to 1 year) 3 . In the above equation, creatinine clearance is in mL/min/1.73 m 2 , body length or height is in centimeters, and serum creatinine is in mg/dL. For pediatric patients with a creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , the dose of cefdinir should be 7 mg/kg (up to 300 mg) given once daily. Patients on Hemodialysis Hemodialysis removes cefdinir from the body. In patients maintained on chronic hemodialysis, the recommended initial dosage regimen is a 300 mg or 7 mg/kg dose every other day. At the conclusion of each hemodialysis session, 300 mg (or 7 mg/kg) should be given. Subsequent doses (300 mg or 7 mg/kg) are then administered every other day.\"\n",

( 2 ) Heart failure: Start at 3.125 mg twice daily and increase to 6.25, 12.5, and then 25 mg twice daily over intervals of at least 2 weeks. Maintain lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. ( 2.1 ) Left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction: Start at 6.25 mg twice daily and increase to 12.5 mg then 25 mg twice daily after intervals of 3 to 10 days. A lower starting dose or slower titration may be used.( 2.2 ) Hypertension: Start at 6.25 mg twice daily and increase if needed for blood pressure control to 12.5 mg and then 25 mg twice daily over intervals of 1 to 2 weeks. ( 2.3 ) Carvedilol should be taken with food to slow the rate of absorption and reduce the incidence of orthostatic effects. 2.1 Heart Failure DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP-TITRATION. Prior to initiation of Carvedilol tablets, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of Carvedilol tablets are 3.125 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. If tolerated, patients may have their dose increased to 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg twice daily over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. A maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily has been administered to patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure weighing over 85 kg (187 lbs). Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. During these periods, patients should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of Carvedilol tablets from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of Carvedilol tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized. Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics. The dose of Carvedilol tablets should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute). Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of Carvedilol tablets can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol. 2.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP-TITRATION. Treatment with carvedilol tablets may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that carvedilol tablets be started at 6.25 mg twice daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 12.5 mg twice daily, then again to the target dose of 25 mg twice daily. A lower starting dose may be used (3.125 mg twice daily) and/or the rate of up-titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral \\u03b2-blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction. 2.3 Hypertension DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of carvedilol tablets are 6.25 mg twice daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about 1 hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 12.5 mg twice daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 25 mg twice daily if tolerated and needed. The full antihypertensive effect of carvedilol tablets are seen within 7 to 14 days. Total daily dose should not exceed 50 mg. Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action. 2.4 Hepatic Impairment Carvedilol tablets should not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) ].\"\n",

            "        \"5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute exacerbation of coronary artery disease upon cessation of therapy: Do not abruptly discontinue. ( 5.1 ) Bradycardia, hypotension, worsening heart failure/fluid retention may occur. Reduce the dose as needed. ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Non-allergic bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis and emphysema): Avoid \\u03b2-blockers. ( 4 ) However, if deemed necessary, use with caution and at lowest effective dose. ( 5.5 ) Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cessation of Therapy Patients with coronary artery disease, who are being treated with carvedilol tablets, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with angina following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \\u03b2-blockers. The last 2 complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other \\u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of carvedilol tablets are planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. Carvedilol tablets should be discontinued over 1 to 2 weeks whenever possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that carvedilol tablets be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue therapy with carvedilol abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension or heart failure. 5.2 Bradycardia In clinical trials, carvedilol tablets caused bradycardia in about 2% of hypertensive subjects, 9% of subjects with heart failure, and 6.5% of subjects with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction. If pulse rate drops below 55 beats per minute, the dosage should be reduced. 5.3 Hypotension In clinical trials of primarily mild-to-moderate heart failure, hypotension and postural hypotension occurred in 9.7% and syncope in 3.4% of subjects receiving carvedilol tablets compared with 3.6% and 2.5% of placebo subjects, respectively. The risk for these events was highest during the first 30 days of dosing, corresponding to the up-titration period and was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.7% of subjects receiving carvedilol tablets, compared with 0.4% of placebo subjects. In a long-term, placebo-controlled trial in severe heart failure (COPERNICUS), hypotension and postural hypotension occurred in 15.1% and syncope in 2.9% of heart failure subjects receiving carvedilol tablets compared with 8.7% and 2.3% of placebo subjects, respectively. These events were a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 1.1% of subjects receiving carvedilol tablets, compared with 0.8% of placebo subjects. Postural hypotension occurred in 1.8% and syncope in 0.1% of hypertensive subjects, primarily following the initial dose or at the time of dose increase and was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 1% of subjects. In the CAPRICORN trial of survivors of an acute myocardial infarction, hypotension or postural hypotension occurred in 20.2% of subjects receiving carvedilol tablets compared with 12.6% of placebo subjects. Syncope was reported in 3.9% and 1.9% of subjects, respectively. These events were a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 2.5% of subjects receiving carvedilol tablets, compared with 0.2% of placebo subjects. Starting with a low dose, administration with food, and gradual up-titration should decrease the likelihood of syncope or excessive hypotension [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) ]. During initiation of therapy, the patient should be cautioned to avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where injury could result should syncope occur. 5.4 Heart Failure/Fluid Retention Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up-titration of carvedilol. If such symptoms occur, diuretics should be increased and the carvedilol dose should not be advanced until clinical stability resumes [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Occasionally it is necessary to lower the carvedilol dose or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol. In a placebo-controlled trial of subjects with severe heart failure, worsening heart failure during the first 3 months was reported to a similar degree with carvedilol and with placebo. When treatment was maintained beyond 3 months, worsening heart failure was reported less frequently in subjects treated with carvedilol than with placebo. Worsening heart failure observed during long-term therapy is more likely to be related to the patients\\u2019 underlying disease than to treatment with carvedilol. 5.5 Non-allergic Bronchospasm Patients with bronchospastic disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) should, in general, not receive \\u03b2-blockers. Carvedilol tablets may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive agents. It is prudent, if carvedilol tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous \\u03b2-agonists is minimized. In clinical trials of subjects with heart failure, subjects with bronchospastic disease were enrolled if they did not require oral or inhaled medication to treat their bronchospastic disease. In such patients, it is recommended that carvedilol be used with caution. The dosing recommendations should be followed closely and the dose should be lowered if any evidence of bronchospasm is observed during up-titration. 5.6 Effects on Blood Sugar Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery not eating regularly or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. In patients with heart failure and diabetes, carvedilol therapy may lead to worsening hyperglycemia, which responds to intensification of hypoglycemic therapy. It is recommended that blood glucose be monitored when carvedilol dosing is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued. Trials designed to examine the effects of carvedilol on glycemic control in patients with diabetes and heart failure have not been conducted. In a trial designed to examine the effects of carvedilol on glycemic control in a population with mild-to-moderate hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, carvedilol had no adverse effect on glycemic control, based on HbA1c measurements [( 14.4 )]. 5.7 Peripheral Vascular Disease \\u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals. 5.8 Deterioration of Renal Function Rarely, use of carvedilol in patients with heart failure has resulted in deterioration of renal function. Patients at risk appear to be those with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg), ischemic heart disease and diffuse vascular disease, and/or underlying renal insufficiency. Renal function has returned to baseline when carvedilol was stopped. In patients with these risk factors it is recommended that renal function be monitored during up-titration of carvedilol and the drug discontinued or dosage reduced if worsening of renal function occurs. 5.9 Major Surgery Chronically administered \\u03b2-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. 5.10 Thyrotoxicosis \\u03b2-adrenergic blockade may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \\u03b2-blockade may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate thyroid storm. 5.11 Pheochromocytoma In patients with pheochromocytoma, an \\u03b1-blocking agent should be initiated prior to the use of any \\u03b2-blocking agent. Although carvedilol has both \\u03b1- and \\u03b2-blocking pharmacologic activities, there has been no experience with its use in this condition. Therefore, caution should be taken in the administration of carvedilol to patients suspected of having pheochromocytoma. 5.12 Prinzmetal\\u2019s Variant Angina Agents with non-selective \\u03b2-blocking activity may provoke chest pain in patients with Prinzmetal\\u2019s variant angina. There has been no clinical experience with carvedilol in these patients although the \\u03b1-blocking activity may prevent such symptoms. However, caution should be taken in the administration of carvedilol to patients suspected of having Prinzmetal\\u2019s variant angina. 5.13 Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction While taking \\u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. 5.14 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha-1 blockers (carvedilol is an alpha/beta blocker). This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to the surgical technique, such as utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. There does not appear to be a benefit of stopping alpha-1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery.\"\n",

Carvedilol tablets have been evaluated for safety in subjects with heart failure (mild, moderate, and severe), in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction and in hypertensive subjects. The observed adverse event profile was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the subjects in the clinical trials. Adverse events reported for each of these patient populations are provided below. Excluded are adverse events considered too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population. Rates of adverse events were generally similar across demographic subsets (men and women, elderly and non-elderly, blacks and non-blacks). Heart Failure Carvedilol tablets have been evaluated for safety in heart failure in more than 4,500 subjects worldwide of whom more than 2,100 participated in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Approximately 60% of the total treated population in placebo-controlled clinical trials received Carvedilol tablets for at least 6 months and 30% received Carvedilol tablets for at least 12 months. In the COMET trial, 1,511 subjects with mild-to-moderate heart failure were treated with Carvedilol tablets for up to 5.9 years (mean: 4.8 years). Both in US clinical trials in mild-to-moderate heart failure that compared Carvedilol tablets in daily doses up to 100 mg (n = 765) with placebo (n = 437), and in a multinational clinical trial in severe heart failure (COPERNICUS) that compared Carvedilol tablets in daily doses up to 50 mg (n = 1,156) with placebo (n = 1,133), discontinuation rates for adverse experiences were similar in carvedilol and placebo subjects. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the only cause of discontinuation greater than 1% and occurring more often on carvedilol was dizziness (1.3% on carvedilol, 0.6% on placebo in the COPERNICUS trial). Table 1 shows adverse events reported in subjects with mild-to-moderate heart failure enrolled in US placebo-controlled clinical trials, and with severe heart failure enrolled in the COPERNICUS trial. Shown are adverse events that occurred more frequently in drug-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects with an incidence of greater than 3% in subjects treated with carvedilol regardless of causality. Median trial medication exposure was 6.3 months for both carvedilol and placebo subjects in the trials of mild-to-moderate heart failure, and 10.4 months in the trial of subjects with severe heart failure. The adverse event profile of Carvedilol tablets observed in the long-term COMET trial was generally similar to that observed in the US Heart Failure Trials.

Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction Carvedilol tablets have been evaluated for safety in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction in the CAPRICORN trial which involved 969 subjects who received carvedilol tablets and 980 who received placebo. Approximately 75% of the subjects received carvedilol tablets for at least 6 months and 53% received carvedilol tablets for at least 12 months. Subjects were treated for an average of 12.9 months and 12.8 months with carvedilol tablets and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse events reported with carvedilol tablets in the CAPRICORN trial were consistent with the profile of the drug in the US heart failure trials and the COPERNICUS trial. The only additional adverse events reported in CAPRICORN in greater than 3% of the subjects and more commonly on carvedilol were dyspnea, anemia, and lung edema. The following adverse events were reported with a frequency of greater than 1% but less than or equal to 3% and more frequently with carvedilol tablets: flu syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disorder, hypotonia, depression, gastrointestinal pain, arthritis, and gout. The overall rates of discontinuations due to adverse events were similar in both groups of subjects. In this database, the only cause of discontinuation greater than 1% and occurring more often on carvedilol was hypotension (1.5% on carvedilol, 0.2% on placebo). Hypertension Carvedilol tablets have been evaluated for safety in hypertension in more than 2,193 subjects in US clinical trials and in 2,976 subjects in international clinical trials. Approximately 36% of the total treated population received carvedilol tablets for at least 6 months. Most adverse events reported during therapy with carvedilol tablets were of mild to moderate severity. In US controlled clinical trials directly comparing carvedilol tablets in doses up to 50 mg (n = 1,142) with placebo (n = 462), 4.9% of subjects receiving carvedilol tablets discontinued for adverse events versus 5.2% of placebo subjects. Although there was no overall difference in discontinuation rates, discontinuations were more common in the carvedilol group for postural hypotension (1% versus 0). The overall incidence of adverse events in US placebo-controlled trials increased with increasing dose of carvedilol tablets. For individual adverse events this could only be distinguished for dizziness, which increased in frequency from 2% to 5% as total daily dose increased from 6.25 mg to 50 mg. Table 2 shows adverse events in US placebo-controlled clinical trials for hypertension that occurred with an incidence of greater than or equal to 1% regardless of causality and that were more frequent in drug-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects. Table 2 Adverse Events (%) Occurring in US Placebo-Controlled Hypertension Trials (Incidence > 1%, Regardless of Causality) Shown are events with rate >1% rounded to nearest integer.

Laboratory Abnormalities Reversible elevations in serum transaminases (ALT or AST) have been observed during treatment with carvedilol tablets. Rates of transaminase elevations (2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal) observed during controlled clinical trials have generally been similar between subjects treated with carvedilol tablets and those treated with placebo. However, transaminase elevations, confirmed by rechallenge, have been observed with carvedilol tablets. In a long-term, placebo-controlled trial in severe heart failure, subjects treated with carvedilol tablets had lower values for hepatic transaminases than subjects treated with placebo, possibly because improvements in cardiac function induced by carvedilol led to less hepatic congestion and/or improved hepatic blood flow. Carvedilol tablets have not been associated with clinically significant changes in serum potassium, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. No clinically relevant changes were noted in fasting serum glucose in hypertensive patients; fasting serum glucose was not evaluated in the heart failure clinical trials. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of carvedilol tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Aplastic anemia. Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, urticaria). Renal and Urinary Disorders Urinary incontinence. Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Interstitial pneumonitis. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme.\"\n",

( 7.1 , 7.5 ) Hypotensive agents (e.g., reserpine, MAO inhibitors, clonidine) may increase the risk of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia. ( 7.4 ) Cyclosporine or digoxin levels may increase. ( 7.3 , 7.4 ) Both digitalis glycosides and \\u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. ( 7.4 ) Amiodarone may increase carvedilol levels resulting in further slowing of the heart rate or cardiac conduction. ( 7.6 ) Verapamil- or diltiazem-type calcium channel blockers may affect ECG and/or blood pressure. ( 7.7 ) Insulin and oral hypoglycemics action may be enhanced. ( 7.8 ) 7.1 CYP2D6 Inhibitors and Poor Metabolizers Interactions of carvedilol with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 isoenzyme (such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of carvedilol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Retrospective analysis of side effects in clinical trials showed that poor 2D6 metabolizers had a higher rate of dizziness during up-titration, presumably resulting from vasodilating effects of the higher concentrations of the \\u03b1-blocking R(+) enantiomer. 7.2 Hypotensive Agents Patients taking a \\u03b2-blocker and a drug that can deplete catecholamines (e.g., reserpine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should be observed closely for signs of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia. Concomitant administration of clonidine with a \\u03b2-blocker may cause hypotension and bradycardia. When concomitant treatment with a \\u03b2-blocker and clonidine is to be terminated, the \\u03b2-blocker should be discontinued first. Clonidine therapy can then be discontinued several days later by gradually decreasing the dosage. 7.3 Cyclosporine Modest increases in mean trough cyclosporine concentrations were observed following initiation of carvedilol treatment in 21 renal transplant subjects suffering from chronic vascular rejection. In about 30% of subjects, the dose of cyclosporine had to be reduced in order to maintain cyclosporine concentrations within the therapeutic range, while in the remainder no adjustment was needed. On the average for the group, the dose of cyclosporine was reduced about 20% in these subjects. Due to wide interindividual variability in the dose adjustment required, it is recommended that cyclosporine concentrations be monitored closely after initiation of carvedilol therapy and that the dose of cyclosporine be adjusted as appropriate. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Both digitalis glycosides and \\u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Digoxin concentrations are increased by about 15% when digoxin and carvedilol are administered concomitantly. Therefore, increased monitoring of digoxin is recommended when initiating, adjusting, or discontinuing carvedilol tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. 7.5 Inducers/Inhibitors of Hepatic Metabolism Rifampin reduced plasma concentrations of carvedilol by about 70% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. Cimetidine increased AUC by about 30% but caused no change in C max [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. 7.6 Amiodarone Amiodarone, and its metabolite desethyl amiodarone, inhibitors of CYP2C9, and P-glycoprotein, increased concentrations of the S(-) -enantiomer of carvedilol by at least 2 fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ].The concomitant administration of amiodarone or other CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole with carvedilol may enhance the \\u03b2-blocking activity, resulting in further slowing of the heart rate or cardiac conduction. Patients should be observed for signs of bradycardia or heart block, particularly when one agent is added to pre-existing treatment with the other. 7.7 Calcium Channel Blockers Conduction disturbance (rarely with hemodynamic compromise) has been observed when carvedilol tablet is co-administered with diltiazem. As with other \\u03b2-blockers, if carvedilol tablet is administered with calcium channel blockers of the verapamil or diltiazem type, it is recommended that ECG and blood pressure be monitored. 7.8 Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics \\u03b2-blockers may enhance the blood-sugar-reducing effect of insulin and oral hypoglycemics. Therefore, in patients taking insulin or oral hypoglycemics, regular monitoring of blood glucose is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 7.9 Anesthesia If treatment with carvedilol is to be continued perioperatively, particular care should be taken when anesthetic agents that depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used [see Overdosage (10) ].\"\n",

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data regarding use of carvedilol in pregnant women are insufficient to determine whether there are drug-associated risks of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy. The use of beta blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression in the neonate [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at clinically relevant doses [see Data] . Oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in post-implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and an increased frequency of delayed fetal skeletal development at maternally toxic doses that were 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). In addition, oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased post-implantation loss at doses 25 times the MRHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/ or Embryo/ Fetal Risk: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Fetal/ Neonatal Adverse Reactions: Neonates of women with hypertension who are treated with beta-blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may be at increased risk for hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression and manage accordingly. Data Animal Data: Studies performed in rats and rabbits given carvedilol during fetal organogenesis revealed increased post-implantation loss in rats at a maternally toxic dose of 300 mg per kg per day (50 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ) and in rabbits (in the absence of maternal toxicity) at doses of 75 mg per kg per day (25 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ). In the rats, there was also a decrease in fetal body weight at 300 mg per kg per day (50 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ), accompanied by an increased incidence of fetuses with delayed skeletal development. In rats, the no-effect level for embryo-fetal toxicity was 60 mg per kg per day (10 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ); in rabbits, it was 15 mg per kg per day (5 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 . In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats administered carvedilol from late gestation through lactation, increased embryo-lethality was observed at a maternally toxic dose of 200mg per kg per day (approximately 32 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ), and pup mortality and delays in physical growth / development were observed at 60 mg per kg per day (10 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ) in the absence of maternal toxicity. The no-effect level was 12 mg per kg per day (2 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ). Carvedilol was present in fetal rat tissue. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of carvedilol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Carvedilol is present in the milk of lactating rats. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\\u2019s clinical need for carvedilol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from carvedilol or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Effectiveness of carvedilol tablets in patients younger than 18 years has not been established. In a double-blind trial, 161 children (mean age: 6 years; range: 2 months to 17 years; 45% younger than 2 years) with chronic heart failure [NYHA class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% for children with a systemic left ventricle (LV), and moderate-severe ventricular dysfunction qualitatively by echo for those with a systemic ventricle that was not an LV] who were receiving standard background treatment were randomized to placebo or to 2 dose levels of carvedilol. These dose levels produced placebo-corrected heart rate reduction of 4 to 6 heart beats per minute, indicative of \\u03b2-blockade activity. Exposure appeared to be lower in pediatric subjects than adults. After 8 months of follow-up, there was no significant effect of treatment on clinical outcomes. Adverse reactions in this trial that occurred in greater than 10% of subjects treated with carvedilol and at twice the rate of placebo-treated subjects included chest pain (17% versus 6%), dizziness (13% versus 2%), and dyspnea (11% versus 0%). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 765 subjects with heart failure randomized to carvedilol in US clinical trials, 31% (235) were aged 65 years or older, and 7.3% (56) were aged 75 years or older. Of the 1,156 subjects randomized to carvedilol in a long-term, placebo-controlled trial in severe heart failure, 47% (547) were aged 65 years or older, and 15% (174) were aged 75 years or older. Of 3,025 subjects receiving carvedilol in heart failure trials worldwide, 42% were aged 65 years or older. Of the 975 subjects with myocardial infarction randomized to carvedilol tablets in the CAPRICORN trial, 48% (468) were aged 65 years or older, and 11% (111) were aged 75 years or older. Of the 2,065 hypertensive subjects in US clinical trials of efficacy or safety who were treated with carvedilol tablets, 21% (436) were aged 65 years or older. Of 3,722 subjects receiving carvedilol tablets in hypertension clinical trials conducted worldwide, 24% were aged 65 years or older. With the exception of dizziness in hypertensive subjects (incidence 8.8% in the elderly versus 6% in younger subjects), no overall differences in the safety or effectiveness (see Figures 2 and 4 ) were observed between the older subjects and younger subjects in each of these populations. Similarly, other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\"\n",

            "        \"8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data regarding use of carvedilol in pregnant women are insufficient to determine whether there are drug-associated risks of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy. The use of beta blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression in the neonate [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at clinically relevant doses [see Data] . Oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in post-implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and an increased frequency of delayed fetal skeletal development at maternally toxic doses that were 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). In addition, oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased post-implantation loss at doses 25 times the MRHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/ or Embryo/ Fetal Risk: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Fetal/ Neonatal Adverse Reactions: Neonates of women with hypertension who are treated with beta-blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may be at increased risk for hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression and manage accordingly. Data Animal Data: Studies performed in rats and rabbits given carvedilol during fetal organogenesis revealed increased post-implantation loss in rats at a maternally toxic dose of 300 mg per kg per day (50 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ) and in rabbits (in the absence of maternal toxicity) at doses of 75 mg per kg per day (25 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ).

Respiratory problems, bronchospasms, vomiting, lapses of consciousness, and generalized seizures may also occur. The patient should be placed in a supine position and, where necessary, kept under observation and treated under intensive-care conditions. The following agents may be administered: For excessive bradycardia: Atropine, 2 mg IV. To support cardiovascular function: Glucagon, 5 to 10 mg IV rapidly over 30 seconds, followed by a continuous infusion of 5 mg per hour; sympathomimetics (dobutamine, isoprenaline, adrenaline) at doses according to body weight and effect. If peripheral vasodilation dominates, it may be necessary to administer adrenaline or noradrenaline with continuous monitoring of circulatory conditions. For therapy-resistant bradycardia, pacemaker therapy should be performed. For bronchospasm, \\u03b2-sympathomimetics (as aerosol or IV) or aminophylline IV should be given. In the event of seizures, slow IV injection of diazepam or clonazepam is recommended. NOTE: In the event of severe intoxication where there are symptoms of shock, treatment with antidotes must be continued for a sufficiently long period of time consistent with the 7- to 10-hour half-life of carvedilol. Cases of overdosage with carvedilol tablets alone or in combination with other drugs have been reported. Quantities ingested in some cases exceeded 1,000 milligrams.

            "        \"12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Carvedilol is a racemic mixture in which nonselective \\u03b2-adrenoreceptor blocking activity is present in the S(-) enantiomer and \\u03b1 1 -adrenergic blocking activity is present in both R(+) and S(-) enantiomers at equal potency. Carvedilol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Heart Failure The basis for the beneficial effects of carvedilol tablets in heart failure is not established. Two placebo-controlled trials compared the acute hemodynamic effects of carvedilol tablets with baseline measurements in 59 and 49 subjects with NYHA class II-IV heart failure receiving diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digitalis. There were significant reductions in systemic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and heart rate. Initial effects on cardiac output, stroke volume index, and systemic vascular resistance were small and variable. These trials measured hemodynamic effects again at 12 to 14 weeks. Carvedilol tablets significantly reduced systemic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, right atrial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and heart rate, while stroke volume index was increased. Among 839 subjects with NYHA class II-III heart failure treated for 26 to 52 weeks in 4 US placebo-controlled trials, average left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) measured by radionuclide ventriculography increased by 9 EF units (%) in subjects receiving carvedilol tablets and by 2 EF units in placebo subjects at a target dose of 25 to 50 mg twice daily. The effects of carvedilol on ejection fraction were related to dose. Doses of 6.25 mg twice daily, 12.5 mg twice daily, and 25 mg twice daily were associated with placebo-corrected increases in EF of 5 EF units, 6 EF units, and 8 EF units, respectively; each of these effects were nominally statistically significant. Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction The basis for the beneficial effects of carvedilol tablets in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following an acute myocardial infarction is not established. Hypertension The mechanism by which \\u03b2-blockade produces an antihypertensive effect has not been established. \\u03b2-adrenoreceptor blocking activity has been demonstrated in animal and human studies showing that carvedilol (1) reduces cardiac output in normal subjects, (2) reduces exercise- and/or isoproterenol-induced tachycardia; and (3) reduces reflex orthostatic tachycardia. Significant \\u03b2-adrenoreceptor blocking effect is usually seen within 1 hour of drug administration. \\u03b1 1 -adrenoreceptor blocking activity has been demonstrated in human and animal studies, showing that carvedilol (1) attenuates the pressor effects of phenylephrine, (2) causes vasodilation; and (3) reduces peripheral vascular resistance. These effects contribute to the reduction of blood pressure and usually are seen within 30 minutes of drug administration. Due to the \\u03b1 1 -receptor blocking activity of carvedilol, blood pressure is lowered more in the standing than in the supine position, and symptoms of postural hypotension (1.8%), including rare instances of syncope, can occur. Following oral administration, when postural hypotension has occurred, it has been transient and is uncommon when carvedilol tablets is administered with food at the recommended starting dose and titration increments are closely followed [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of carvedilol tablets decreased renal vascular resistance with no change in glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow. Changes in excretion of sodium, potassium, uric acid, and phosphorus in hypertensive patients with normal renal function were similar after carvedilol tablets and placebo. Carvedilol tablets have little effect on plasma catecholamines, plasma aldosterone, or electrolyte levels, but it does significantly reduce plasma renin activity when given for at least 4 weeks. It also increases levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Carvedilol tablets are rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration, with absolute bioavailability of approximately 25% to 35% due to a significant degree of first-pass metabolism. Following oral administration, the apparent mean terminal elimination half-life of carvedilol generally ranges from 7 to 10 hours. Plasma concentrations achieved are proportional to the oral dose administered. When administered with food, the rate of absorption is slowed, as evidenced by a delay in the time to reach peak plasma levels, with no significant difference in extent of bioavailability. Taking carvedilol tablets with food should minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension. Carvedilol is extensively metabolized. Following oral administration of radiolabelled carvedilol to healthy volunteers, carvedilol accounted for only about 7% of the total radioactivity in plasma as measured by area under the curve (AUC). Less than 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Carvedilol is metabolized primarily by aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation. The oxidative metabolites are further metabolized by conjugation via glucuronidation and sulfation. The metabolites of carvedilol are excreted primarily via the bile into the feces. Demethylation and hydroxylation at the phenol ring produce 3 active metabolites with \\u03b2-receptor blocking activity. Based on preclinical studies, the 4\\u2019-hydroxyphenyl metabolite is approximately 13 times more potent than carvedilol for \\u03b2-blockade. Compared with carvedilol, the 3 active metabolites exhibit weak vasodilating activity. Plasma concentrations of the active metabolites are about one-tenth of those observed for carvedilol and have pharmacokinetics similar to the parent. Carvedilol undergoes stereoselective first-pass metabolism with plasma levels of R(+)-carvedilol approximately 2 to 3 times higher than S(-)-carvedilol following oral administration in healthy subjects. The mean apparent terminal elimination half-lives for R(+)-carvedilol range from 5 to 9 hours compared with 7 to 11 hours for the S(-)-enantiomer. The primary P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of both R(+) and S(-)-carvedilol in human liver microsomes were CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, 2C19, 1A2, and 2E1. CYP2D6 is thought to be the major enzyme in the 4\\u2019- and 5\\u2019-hydroxylation of carvedilol, with a potential contribution from 3A4. CYP2C9 is thought to be of primary importance in the O-methylation pathway of S(-)-carvedilol. Carvedilol is subject to the effects of genetic polymorphism with poor metabolizers of debrisoquin (a marker for cytochrome P450 2D6) exhibiting 2- to 3-fold higher plasma concentrations of R(+)-carvedilol compared with extensive metabolizers. In contrast, plasma levels of S(-)-carvedilol are increased only about 20% to 25% in poor metabolizers, indicating this enantiomer is metabolized to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 2D6 than R(+)-carvedilol. The pharmacokinetics of carvedilol do not appear to be different in poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin (patients deficient in cytochrome P450 2C19). Carvedilol is more than 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily with albumin. The plasma-protein binding is independent of concentration over the therapeutic range. Carvedilol is a basic, lipophilic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of approximately 115 L, indicating substantial distribution into extravascular tissues. Plasma clearance ranges from 500 to 700 mL/min. 12.4 Specific Populations Heart Failure Steady-state plasma concentrations of carvedilol and its enantiomers increased proportionally over the 6.25-to 50-mg dose range in subjects with heart failure. Compared with healthy subjects, subjects with heart failure had increased mean AUC and C max values for carvedilol and its enantiomers, with up to 50% to 100% higher values observed in 6 subjects with NYHA class IV heart failure. The mean apparent terminal elimination half-life for carvedilol was similar to that observed in healthy subjects. Geriatric Plasma levels of carvedilol average about 50% higher in the elderly compared with young subjects. Hepatic Impairment Compared with healthy subjects, patients with severe liver impairment (cirrhosis) exhibit a 4- to 7-fold increase in carvedilol levels. Carvedilol is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment. Renal Impairment Although carvedilol is metabolized primarily by the liver, plasma concentrations of carvedilol have been reported to be increased in patients with renal impairment. Based on mean AUC data, approximately 40% to 50% higher plasma concentrations of carvedilol were observed in subjects with hypertension and moderate to severe renal impairment compared with a control group of subjects with hypertension and normal renal function. However, the ranges of AUC values were similar for both groups. Changes in mean peak plasma levels were less pronounced, approximately 12% to 26% higher in subjects with impaired renal function. Consistent with its high degree of plasma protein-binding, carvedilol does not appear to be cleared significantly by hemodialysis. 12.5 Drug-Drug Interactions Since carvedilol undergoes substantial oxidative metabolism, the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of carvedilol may be affected by induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Amiodarone In a pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 106 Japanese subjects with heart failure, coadministration of small loading and maintenance doses of amiodarone with carvedilol resulted in at least a 2-fold increase in the steady-state trough concentrations of S(-) -carvedilol [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]. Cimetidine In a pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 10 healthy male subjects, cimetidine (1,000 mg per day) increased the steady-state AUC of carvedilol by 30% with no change in C max [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Digoxin Following concomitant administration of carvedilol (25 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 14 days, steady-state AUC and trough concentrations of digoxin were increased by 14% and 16%, respectively, in 12 subjects with hypertension. [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Glyburide In 12 healthy subjects, combined administration of carvedilol (25 mg once daily) and a single dose of glyburide did not result in a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction for either compound. Hydrochlorothiazide A single oral dose of carvedilol 25 mg did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in 12 subjects with hypertension. Likewise, hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol. Rifampin In a pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 8 healthy male subjects, rifampin (600 mg daily for 12 days) decreased the AUC and C max of carvedilol by about 70% [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Torsemide In a trial of 12 healthy subjects, combined oral administration of carvedilol 25 mg once daily and torsemide 5 mg once daily for 5 days did not result in any significant differences in their pharmacokinetics compared with administration of the drugs alone. Warfarin Carvedilol (12.5 mg twice daily) did not have an effect on the steady-state prothrombin time ratios and did not alter the pharmacokinetics of R(+) - and S(-)-warfarin following concomitant administration with warfarin in 9 healthy volunteers.\"\n",

CYP2C9 is thought to be of primary importance in the O-methylation pathway of S(-)-carvedilol. Carvedilol is subject to the effects of genetic polymorphism with poor metabolizers of debrisoquin (a marker for cytochrome P450 2D6) exhibiting 2- to 3-fold higher plasma concentrations of R(+)-carvedilol compared with extensive metabolizers. In contrast, plasma levels of S(-)-carvedilol are increased only about 20% to 25% in poor metabolizers, indicating this enantiomer is metabolized to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 2D6 than R(+)-carvedilol. The pharmacokinetics of carvedilol do not appear to be different in poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin (patients deficient in cytochrome P450 2C19). Carvedilol is more than 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily with albumin. The plasma-protein binding is independent of concentration over the therapeutic range. Carvedilol is a basic, lipophilic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of approximately 115 L, indicating substantial distribution into extravascular tissues. Plasma clearance ranges from 500 to 700 mL/min.\"\n",

            "        \"14. CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Heart Failure A total of 6,975 subjects with mild to severe heart failure were evaluated in placebo-controlled trials of carvedilol. Mild-to-Moderate Heart Failure Carvedilol was studied in 5 multicenter, placebo-controlled trials, and in 1 active-controlled trial (COMET trial) involving subjects with mild-to-moderate heart failure. Four US multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolled 1,094 subjects (696 randomized to carvedilol) with NYHA class II-III heart failure and ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.35. The vast majority were on digitalis, diuretics, and an ACE inhibitor at trial entry. Patients were assigned to the trials based upon exercise ability. An Australia-New Zealand double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 415 subjects (half randomized to carvedilol) with less severe heart failure. All protocols excluded subjects expected to undergo cardiac transplantation during the 7.5 to 15 months of double-blind follow-up. All randomized subjects had tolerated a 2-week course on carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily. In each trial, there was a primary end point, either progression of heart failure (1 US trial) or exercise tolerance (2 US trials meeting enrollment goals and the Australia-New Zealand trial). There were many secondary end points specified in these trials, including NYHA classification, patient and physician global assessments, and cardiovascular hospitalization. Other analyses not prospectively planned included the sum of deaths and total cardiovascular hospitalizations. In situations where the primary end points of a trial do not show a significant benefit of treatment, assignment of significance values to the other results is complex, and such values need to be interpreted cautiously. The results of the US and Australia-New Zealand trials were as follows: Slowing Progression of Heart Failure One US multicenter trial (366 subjects) had as its primary end point the sum of cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalization, and sustained increase in heart failure medications. Heart failure progression was reduced, during an average follow-up of 7 months, by 48% (P = 0.008). In the Australia-New Zealand trial, death and total hospitalizations were reduced by about 25% over 18 to 24 months. In the 3 largest US trials, death and total hospitalizations were reduced by 19%, 39%, and 49%, nominally statistically significant in the last 2 trials. The Australia-New Zealand results were statistically borderline. Functional Measures None of the multicenter trials had NYHA classification as a primary end point, but all such trials had it as a secondary end point. There was at least a trend toward improvement in NYHA class in all trials. Exercise tolerance was the primary end point in 3 trials; in none was a statistically significant effect found. Subjective Measures Health-related quality of life, as measured with a standard questionnaire (a primary end point in 1 trial), was unaffected by carvedilol. However, patients\\u2019 and investigators\\u2019 global assessments showed significant improvement in most trials. Mortality Death was not a pre-specified end point in any trial, but was analyzed in all trials. Overall, in these 4 US trials, mortality was reduced, nominally significantly so in 2 trials. The COMET Trial In this double-blind trial, 3,029 subjects with NYHA class II-IV heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) were randomized to receive either carvedilol (target dose: 25 mg twice daily) or immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose: 50 mg twice daily). The mean age of the subjects was approximately 62 years, 80% were males, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 26%. Approximately 96% of the subjects had NYHA class II or III heart failure. Concomitant treatment included diuretics (99%), ACE inhibitors (91%), digitalis (59%), aldosterone antagonists (11%), and \\u201cstatin\\u201d lipid-lowering agents (21%). The mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. The mean dose of carvedilol was 42 mg per day. The trial had 2 primary end points: all-cause mortality and the composite of death plus hospitalization for any reason. The results of COMET are presented in Table 3 below. All-cause mortality carried most of the statistical weight and was the primary determinant of the trial size. All-cause mortality was 34% in the subjects treated with carvedilol and was 40% in the immediate-release metoprolol group (P = 0.0017; hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.93). The effect on mortality was primarily due to a reduction in cardiovascular death. The difference between the 2 groups with respect to the composite end point was not significant (P = 0.122). The estimated mean survival was 8.0 years with carvedilol and 6.6 years with immediate-release metoprolol. Table 3 Results of COMET End Point Carvedilol N = 1,511 Metoprolol N = 1,518 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) All-cause mortality 34% 40% 0.83 0.74 \\u2013 0.93 Mortality + all hospitalization 74% 76% 0.94 0.86 \\u2013 1.02 Cardiovascular death 30% 35% 0.80 0.70 \\u2013 0.90 Sudden death Death due to circulatory failure Death due to stroke 14% 11% 0.9% 17% 13% 2.5% 0.81 0.83 0.33 0.68 \\u2013 0.97 0.67 \\u2013 1.02 0.18 \\u2013 0.62 It is not known whether this formulation of metoprolol at any dose or this low dose of metoprolol in any formulation has any effect on survival or hospitalization in patients with heart failure. Thus, this trial extends the time over which carvedilol manifests benefits on survival in heart failure, but it is not evidence that carvedilol improves outcome over the formulation of metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) with benefits in heart failure. Severe Heart Failure (COPERNICUS) In a double-blind trial (COPERNICUS), 2,289 subjects with heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25% (mean 20%), despite digitalis (66%), diuretics (99%), and ACE inhibitors (89%) were randomized to placebo or carvedilol. Carvedilol was titrated from a starting dose of 3.125 mg twice daily to the maximum tolerated dose or up to 25 mg twice daily over a minimum of 6 weeks. Most subjects achieved the target dose of 25 mg. The trial was conducted in Eastern and Western Europe, the United States, Israel, and Canada. Similar numbers of subjects per group (about 100) withdrew during the titration period. The primary end point of the trial was all-cause mortality, but cause-specific mortality and the risk of death or hospitalization (total, cardiovascular [CV], or heart failure [HF]) were also examined. The developing trial data were followed by a data monitoring committee, and mortality analyses were adjusted for these multiple looks. The trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 10 months because of an observed 35% reduction in mortality (from 19.7% per patient-year on placebo to 12.8% on carvedilol; hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.81, P = 0.0014, adjusted) (see Figure 1). The results of COPERNICUS are shown in Table 4. Table 4 Results of COPERNICUS Trial in Subjects with Severe Heart Failure End Point Placebo (N = 1,133) Carvedilol (N = 1,156) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) % Reduction Nominal P value Mortality 190 130 0.65 (0.52 \\u2013 0.81) 35 0.00013 Mortality + all hospitalization 507 425 0.76 (0.67 \\u2013 0.87) 24 0.00004 Mortality + CV hospitalization 395 314 0.73 (0.63 \\u2013 0.84) 27 0.00002 Mortality + HF hospitalization 357 271 0.69 (0.59 \\u2013 0.81) 31 0.000004 Cardiovascular = CV; Heart failure = HF. 759 760 Figure 1. Survival Analysis for COPERNICUS (Intent-to-Treat) The effect on mortality was principally the result of a reduction in the rate of sudden death among subjects without worsening heart failure. Patients' global assessments, in which carvedilol-treated subjects were compared with placebo, were based on pre-specified, periodic patient self-assessments regarding whether clinical status post-treatment showed improvement, worsening, or no change compared with baseline. Subjects treated with carvedilol showed significant improvements in global assessments compared with those treated with placebo in COPERNICUS. The protocol also specified that hospitalizations would be assessed. Fewer subjects on carvedilol than on placebo were hospitalized for any reason (372 versus 432, P = 0.0029), for cardiovascular reasons (246 versus 314, P = 0.0003), or for worsening heart failure (198 versus 268, P = 0.0001). Carvedilol tablets had a consistent and beneficial effect on all-cause mortality as well as the combined end points of all-cause mortality plus hospitalization (total, CV, or for heart failure) in the overall trial population and in all subgroups examined, including men and women, elderly and non-elderly, blacks and non-blacks, and diabetics and non-diabetics (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Effects on Mortality for Subgroups in COPERNICUS 14.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction CAPRICORN was a double-blind trial comparing carvedilol and placebo in 1,959 subjects with a recent myocardial infarction (within 21 days) and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40%, with (47%) or without symptoms of heart failure. Subjects given carvedilol received 6.25 mg twice daily, titrated as tolerated to 25 mg twice daily. Subjects had to have a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, a sitting heart rate greater than 60 beats per minute, and no contraindication to \\u03b2-blocker use. Treatment of the index infarction included aspirin (85%), IV or oral \\u03b2-blockers (37%), nitrates (73%), heparin (64%), thrombolytics (40%), and acute angioplasty (12%). Background treatment included ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (97%), anticoagulants (20%), lipid-lowering agents (23%), and diuretics (34%). Baseline population characteristics included an average age of 63 years, 74% male, 95% Caucasian, mean blood pressure 121/74 mm Hg, 22% with diabetes, and 54% with a history of hypertension. Mean dosage achieved of carvedilol was 20 mg twice daily; mean duration of follow-up was 15 months. All-cause mortality was 15% in the placebo group and 12% in the carvedilol group, indicating a 23% risk reduction in subjects treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 2% to 40%, P = 0.03), as shown in Figure 3. The effects on mortality in various subgroups are shown in Figure 4. Nearly all deaths were cardiovascular (which were reduced by 25% by carvedilol), and most of these deaths were sudden or related to pump failure (both types of death were reduced by carvedilol). Another trial end point, total mortality and all-cause hospitalization, did not show a significant improvement. There was also a significant 40% reduction in fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction observed in the group treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 11% to 60%, P = 0.01). A similar reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction was also observed in a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials of carvedilol in heart failure. Figure 3. Survival Analysis for CAPRICORN (Intent-to-Treat) Figure 4. Effects on Mortality for Subgroups in CAPRICORN 14.3 Hypertension Carvedilol tablets were studied in 2 placebo-controlled trials that utilized twice-daily dosing at total daily doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In these and other trials, the starting dose did not exceed 12.5 mg. At 50 mg per day, carvedilol tablets reduced sitting trough (12-hour) blood pressure by about 9/5.5 mm Hg; at 25 mg per day the effect was about 7.5/3.5 mm Hg. Comparisons of trough-to-peak blood pressure showed a trough-to-peak ratio for blood pressure response of about 65%. Heart rate fell by about 7.5 beats per minute at 50 mg per day. In general, as is true for other \\u03b2-blockers, responses were smaller in black than non-black subjects. There were no age- or gender- related differences in response. The peak antihypertensive effect occurred 1 to 2 hours after a dose. The dose-related blood pressure response was accompanied by a dose-related increase in adverse effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 14.4 Hypertension with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In a double-blind trial (GEMINI), carvedilol, added to an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker, was evaluated in a population with mild-to-moderate hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.2%. Carvedilol was titrated to a mean dose of 17.5 mg twice daily and maintained for 5 months. Carvedilol had no adverse effect on glycemic control, based on HbA1c measurements (mean change from baseline of 0.02%, 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.10, P = NS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\"\n",

Active Ingredient: Carvedilol, USP Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, povidone, talc, and titanium dioxide. Carvedilol tablets come in the following strengths: 3.125 mg, 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg and 25 mg. What is high blood pressure (hypertension)? Blood pressure is the force of blood in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. You have high blood pressure when the force is too much. High blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood through the body and causes damage to blood vessels. Carvedilol can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower. Medicines that lower blood pressure may lower your chance of having a stroke or heart attack. Manufactured by: Zydus Lifesciences Ltd., India For BluePoint Laboratories Rev.: 12/23\"\n",

            "        \"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac potassium tablets, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX- 2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to intravenous (IV) administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available (see Table 1 ). In some fasting volunteers, measurable plasma levels are observed within 10 minutes of dosing with diclofenac potassium tablets. Peak plasma levels are achieved approximately 1 hour in fasting normal volunteers, with a range of 0.33 to 2 hours. Food has no significant effect on the extent of diclofenac absorption. However, there is usually a delay in the onset of absorption and a reduction in peak plasma levels of approximately 30%. Table 1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Diclofenac PK Parameter Normal Healthy Adults (20 to 52 years) Mean Coefficient of Variation (%) Absolute bioavailability (%) [N = 7] 55 40 Tmax (hr) [N = 65] 1.0 76 Oral clearance (CL/F; mL/min) [N = 61] 622 21 Renal clearance (% unchanged drug in urine) [N = 7] < 1 - Apparent volume of distribution (V/F; L/kg) [N = 61] 1.3 33 Terminal half-life (hr) [N = 48] 1.9 29 Distribution The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac potassium is 1.3 L/kg. Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15 to 105 mcg/mL) achieved with recommended doses. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4', 5-dihydroxy- and 3'- hydroxy-4'-methoxy-diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. In patients with renal dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4'-hydroxy- and 5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects. Excretion Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. Special Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac potassium tablets have not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Hepatic Impairment Hepatic metabolism accounts for almost 100% of diclofenac potassium tablets elimination, so patients with hepatic disease may require reduced doses of diclofenac potassium tablets compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Renal Impairment Diclofenac pharmacokinetics has been investigated in subjects with renal insufficiency. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac have been detected in studies of patients with renal impairment. In patients with renal impairment (inulin clearance 60 to 90, 30 to 60, and less than 30 mL/min; N = 6 in each group), area under the curve (AUC) values and elimination rate were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Drug Interactions Studies Voriconazole When co-administered with voriconazole (inhibitor of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 enzyme), the Cmax and AUC of diclofenac increased by 114% and 78%, respectively (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ). Aspirin When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions).\"\n",

The mechanism of action of diclofenac potassium tablets, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX- 2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.\"\n",

            "        \"Pharmacokinetics Absorption Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to intravenous (IV) administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available (see Table 1 ). In some fasting volunteers, measurable plasma levels are observed within 10 minutes of dosing with diclofenac potassium tablets. Peak plasma levels are achieved approximately 1 hour in fasting normal volunteers, with a range of 0.33 to 2 hours. Food has no significant effect on the extent of diclofenac absorption. However, there is usually a delay in the onset of absorption and a reduction in peak plasma levels of approximately 30%. Table 1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Diclofenac PK Parameter Normal Healthy Adults (20 to 52 years) Mean Coefficient of Variation (%) Absolute bioavailability (%) [N = 7] 55 40 Tmax (hr) [N = 65] 1.0 76 Oral clearance (CL/F; mL/min) [N = 61] 622 21 Renal clearance (% unchanged drug in urine) [N = 7] < 1 - Apparent volume of distribution (V/F; L/kg) [N = 61] 1.3 33 Terminal half-life (hr) [N = 48] 1.9 29 Distribution The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac potassium is 1.3 L/kg. Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15 to 105 mcg/mL) achieved with recommended doses. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4', 5-dihydroxy- and 3'- hydroxy-4'-methoxy-diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. In patients with renal dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4'-hydroxy- and 5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects. Excretion Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 2 hours.\"\n",

            "        \"WARNINGS Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation ). Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac potassium tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who use NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated Patients Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac potassium tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials of diclofenac- containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (also known as SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac potassium tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \\\"flu- like\\\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac potassium tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac potassium tablets, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac potassium tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, anti-epileptics). Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides diuretics or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalization for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Avoid the use of diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac potassium tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac potassium tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac potassium tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac potassium tablets (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Avoid the use of diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac potassium tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS: Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity ). Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross- reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). When diclofenac potassium tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions and discontinue the use of diclofenac potassium tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac potassium tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac potassium tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Avoid use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs including diclofenac potassium tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit diclofenac potassium tablets use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if diclofenac potassium tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue diclofenac potassium tablets if oligohydramnios occurs and follow-up according to clinical practice (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac potassium tablets have any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ).\"\n",

            "        \"PRECAUTIONS General Diclofenac potassium tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids and the patient should be observed closely for any evidence of adverse effects, including adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of symptoms of arthritis. The pharmacological activity of diclofenac potassium tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions. Information for Patients Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) that accompanies each prescription dispensed. Inform patients, families, or their caregivers of the following information before initiating therapy with diclofenac potassium tablets and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately (see WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events ). Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their healthcare provider. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for the signs and symptoms of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation ). Hepatotoxicity Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, diarrhea, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \\\"flu- like\\\" symptoms). If these occur, instruct patients to stop diclofenac potassium tablets and seek immediate medical therapy (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Heart Failure and Edema Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS: Heart Failure and Edema ). Anaphylactic Reactions Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). Instruct patients to seek immediate emergency help if these occur (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactic Reactions ). Serious Skin Reactions, Including DRESS Advise patients to stop taking diclofenac potassium tablets immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible ( WARNINGS: Serious Skin Reactions ). Female Fertility Advise females of reproductive potential who desire pregnancy that NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, may be associated with a reversible delay in ovulation (see PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). Fetal Toxicity Inform pregnant women to avoid use of diclofenac potassium tablets and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with diclofenac potassium tablets is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours (see WARNINGS: Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation and Drug Interactions ).

Inform patients, families, or their caregivers of the following information before initiating therapy with diclofenac potassium tablets and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately (see WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events ). Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their healthcare provider. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for the signs and symptoms of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation ). Hepatotoxicity Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, diarrhea, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \\\"flu- like\\\" symptoms). If these occur, instruct patients to stop diclofenac potassium tablets and seek immediate medical therapy (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Heart Failure and Edema Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS: Heart Failure and Edema ). Anaphylactic Reactions Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). Instruct patients to seek immediate emergency help if these occur (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactic Reactions ). Serious Skin Reactions, Including DRESS Advise patients to stop taking diclofenac potassium tablets immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible ( WARNINGS: Serious Skin Reactions ). Female Fertility Advise females of reproductive potential who desire pregnancy that NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, may be associated with a reversible delay in ovulation (see PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). Fetal Toxicity Inform pregnant women to avoid use of diclofenac potassium tablets and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with diclofenac potassium tablets is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours (see WARNINGS: Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation and Drug Interactions ).

            "        \"Drug Interactions See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac.Table 2. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding (see WARNINGS: HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY). Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone (see WARNINGS: GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING, ULCERATION, AND PERFORATION). Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding (see WARNINGS: HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY). Diclofenac potassium tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol).In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.During concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function (seeWARNINGS: RENAL TOXICITY AND HYPERKALEMIA).When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects (see WARNINGS: RENAL TOXICITY AND HYPERKALEMIA). Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS: GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING, ULCERATION, AND PERFORATION). Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac potassium tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 mL/min to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration. CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac is administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: PHARMACOKINETICS). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats given diclofenac sodium up to 2 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of diclofenac potassium tablets, 200 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison) have revealed no significant increase in tumor incidence. A 2-year carcinogenicity study conducted in mice employing diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.007 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.02 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in females did not reveal any oncogenic potential. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium did not show mutagenic activity in in vitro point mutation assays in mammalian (mouse lymphoma) and microbial (yeast, Ames) test systems and was nonmutagenic in several mammalian in vitro and in vivo tests, including dominant lethal and male germinal epithelial chromosomal studies in mice, and nucleus anomaly and chromosomal aberration studies in Chinese hamsters. Impairment of Fertility Diclofenac sodium administered to male and female rats at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) did not affect fertility. Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of diclofenac potassium tablets use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid diclofenac potassium tablets use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see WARNINGS: Fetal Toxicity ). Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac potassium tablets in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, or rabbits given diclofenac during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 0.5, 0.5, and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of diclofenac potassium tablets, despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses (see Data) . Based on published animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre-and postimplantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see WARNINGS: Fetal Toxicity ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If diclofenac potassium tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue diclofenac potassium tablets and follow up according to clinical practice (see WARNINGS: Fetal Toxicity ). Data Human Data Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data Reproductive and developmental studies in animals demonstrated that diclofenac sodium administration during organogenesis did not produce teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity in mice at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of diclofenac potassium tablets, 200 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison), and in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 and 1 times, respectively, the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In a study in which pregnant rats were orally administered 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg diclofenac (0.1 and 0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA) from Gestation Day 15 through Lactation Day 21, significant maternal toxicity (peritonitis, mortality) was noted. These maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice, rats, and humans. Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac potassium tablets during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. Nursing Mothers Risk Summary Based on available data, diclofenac may be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for diclofenac potassium tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac potassium tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data One woman treated orally with a diclofenac salt, 150 mg/day, had a milk diclofenac level of 100 mcg/L, equivalent to an infant dose of about 0.03 mg/kg/day. Diclofenac was not detectable in breast milk in 12 women using diclofenac (after either 100 mg/day orally for 7 days or a single 50 mg intramuscular dose administered in the immediate postpartum period). Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects (see WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events , Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation , Hepatotoxicity , Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Monitoring ). Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , ADVERSE REACTIONS ).\"\n",

Data Human Data Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data Reproductive and developmental studies in animals demonstrated that diclofenac sodium administration during organogenesis did not produce teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity in mice at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of diclofenac potassium tablets, 200 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison), and in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 and 1 times, respectively, the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In a study in which pregnant rats were orally administered 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg diclofenac (0.1 and 0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA) from Gestation Day 15 through Lactation Day 21, significant maternal toxicity (peritonitis, mortality) was noted. These maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice, rats, and humans.\"\n",

Do not abruptly substitute montelukast sodium for inhaled or oral corticosteroids ( 5.3 ). \\u2022 Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue to avoid aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium ( 5.4 ). \\u2022 Systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, has been reported. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy ( 5.5 and 6.2 ). \\u2022 Inform patients with phenylketonuria that the 4 mg and 5 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Neuropsychiatric Events Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with use of montelukast sodium. These postmarketing reports have been highly variable and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor. NP events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with and without a previous history of psychiatric disorder. NP events have been reported mostly during montelukast sodium treatment, but some were reported after montelukast sodium discontinuation. Animal studies showed that montelukast distributes into the brain in rats [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]; however, the mechanisms underlying montelukast sodium-associated NP events are currently not well understood. Based upon the available data, it is difficult to identify risk factors for or quantify the risk of NP events with montelukast sodium use. Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies [see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 )]. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium. Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium use with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or for new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately. In many cases, symptoms resolved after stopping montelukast sodium therapy; however, in some cases symptoms persisted after discontinuation of montelukast sodium. Therefore, continue to monitor and provide supportive care until symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur. 5.2 Acute Asthma Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled \\u03b2-agonist. 5.3 Concomitant Corticosteroid Use While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. 5.4 Aspirin Sensitivity Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 5.5 Eosinophilic Conditions Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.6 Risk in Patients with Phenylketonuria Montelukast sodium chewable tablets contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Each 4 mg and 5 mg chewable tablet contains 0.6 mg and 0.75 mg ofphenylalanine, respectively. Before prescribing montelukast sodium to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including montelukast sodium.\"\n",

The frequency of less common adverse reactions was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse reaction profile did not significantly change. Pediatric Patients 6 to 14 Years of Age with Asthma Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 476 pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age. Cumulatively, 289 pediatric patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, and 241 for one year or longer in clinical trials. The safety profile of montelukast sodium in the 8-week, double-blind, pediatric efficacy trial was generally similar to the adult safety profile. In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following reactions occurred with a frequency \\u22652% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: pharyngitis, influenza, fever, sinusitis, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, otitis, viral infection, and laryngitis. The frequency of less common adverse reactions was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. With prolonged treatment, the adverse reaction profile did not significantly change. The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. In studies evaluating growth rate, the safety profile in these pediatric patients was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. In a 56-week, double-blind study evaluating growth rate in pediatric patients 6 to 8 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following reactions not previously observed with the use of montelukast sodium in this age group occurred with a frequency \\u22652% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: headache, rhinitis (infective), varicella, gastroenteritis, atopic dermatitis, acute bronchitis, tooth infection, skin infection, and myopia. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age with Asthma Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 573 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age in single- and multiple-dose studies. Cumulatively, 426 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 3 months, 230 for 6 months or longer, and 63 patients for one year or longer in clinical trials. In pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following reactions occurred with a frequency \\u22652% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis, influenza, rash, ear pain, gastroenteritis, eczema, urticaria, varicella, pneumonia, dermatitis, and conjunctivitis. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following reaction was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency \\u22651% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies. Pediatric Patients 2 to 14 Years of Age with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated in 280 pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age in a 2-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group safety study. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In this study, the following reactions occurred with a frequency \\u22652% and at an incidence greater than placebo: headache, otitis media, pharyngitis, and upper respiratory infection. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following reactions were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency \\u22651% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. Pediatric Patients 2 Years to 14 Years of Age with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis The safety in patients 2 to 14 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis is supported by the safety in patients 2 to 14 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia. Immune system disorders hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration. Psychiatric disorders including, but not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment,obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Nervous system disorders rowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures. Cardiac disorders palpitations. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal disorders diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. Hepatobiliary disorders Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis,urticaria. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps. Renal and urinary disorders enuresis in children. General disorders and administration site conditions edema. Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These reactions have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy.

In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of montelukast to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (MRHDOD) based on AUCs [see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly or moderately controlled asthma in pregnancy increases the maternal risk of perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia and infant prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. Data Human Data Published data from prospective and retrospective cohort studies have not identified an association with montelukast sodium use during pregnancy and major birth defects. Available studies have methodologic limitations, including small sample size, in some cases retrospective data collection, and inconsistent comparator groups. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, montelukast administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17 in rats and 6 to 18 in rabbits) did not cause any adverse developmental effects at maternal oral doses up to 400 and 300 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively (approximately 100 and 110 times the AUC in humans at the MRHDOD, respectively). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary A published clinical lactation study reports the presence of montelukast in human milk. Data available on the effects of the drug on infants, either directly [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] or through breast milk, do not suggest a significant risk of adverse reactions from exposure to montelukast sodium. The effects of the drug on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\\u2019s clinical need for montelukast sodium and any potential adverse reactions on the breastfed infant from montelukast sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of montelukast sodium for asthma have been established in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age. Use of montelukast sodium for this indication is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies. Safety and efficacy data in this age group are similar to those seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Specific Populations (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2 ) ]. The effectiveness of montelukast sodium for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age and for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 6 months to 14 years of age have been established and is supported by extrapolation from the demonstrated effectiveness in patients 15 years of age and older with allergic rhinitis as well as the assumption that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar among these populations. The safety of montelukast sodium 4 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age with asthma has been demonstrated by adequate and well-controlled data [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Effectiveness of montelukast sodium in this age group is extrapolated from the demonstrated effectiveness in patients 6 years of age and older with asthma and is based on similar pharmacokinetic data, as well as the assumption that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar among these populations. effectiveness in this age group is supported by exploratory efficacy assessments from a large, well-controlled safety study conducted in patients 2 to 5 years of age. The safety of montelukast sodium 4 mg and 5 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients aged 2 to 14 years with allergic rhinitis is supported by data from studies conducted in pediatric patients aged 2 to 14 years with asthma. A safety study in pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis demonstrated a similar safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 months with asthma and 6 months with perennial allergic rhinitis, and 6 years with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have not been established. Growth Rate in Pediatric Patients A 56-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled parallel group study was conducted to assess the effect of montelukast sodium on growth rate in 360 patients with mild asthma, aged 6 to 8 years. Treatment groups included montelukast sodium 5 mg once daily, placebo, and beclomethasone dipropionate administered as 168 mcg twice daily with a spacer device. For each subject, a growth rate was defined as the slope of a linear regression line fit to the height measurements over 56 weeks. The primary comparison was the difference in growth rates between montelukast sodium and placebo groups. Growth rates, expressed as least-squares (LS) mean (95% CI) in cm/year, for the montelukast sodium, placebo, and beclomethasone treatment groups were 5.67 (5.46, 5.88), 5.64 (5.42, 5.86), and 4.86 (4.64, 5.08), respectively. The differences in growth rates, expressed as least-squares (LS) mean (95% CI) in cm/year, for montelukast sodium minus placebo, beclomethasone minus placebo, and montelukast sodium minus beclomethasone treatment groups were 0.03 (-0.26,0.31), -0.78 (-1.06, -0.49); and 0.81 (0.53, 1.09), respectively. Growth rate (expressed as mean change in height over time) for each treatment group is shown in FIGURE 1.

            "        \"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , LTE 4 ) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT 1 ) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT 1 receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or \\u03b2-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD 4 at the CysLT 1 receptor without any agonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD 4 in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD 4 -induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively. The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 10 mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (Cmax) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T max ). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and Cmax are not influenced by a standard meal in the morning. For the 5 mg chewable tablet, the mean C max is achieved in 2 to 2.5 hours after administration to adults in the fasted state. The mean oral bioavailability is 73% in the fasted state versus 63% when administered with a standard meal in the morning. For the 4 mg chewable tablet, the mean C max is achieved 2 hours after administration in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age in the fasted state. The 4 mg oral granule formulation is bioequivalent to the 4 mg chewable tablet when administered to adults in the fasted state. The safety and effectiveness of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10 mg film-coated tablet and 5 mg chewable tablet formulations were administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma was also demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 4 mg chewable tablet and 4 mg oral granule formulations were administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and effectiveness of montelukast sodium in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10 mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5 mg chewable tablets versus one 10 mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated. Distribution Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Orally administered montelukast distributes into the brain in rats. Elimination The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and <0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile. In several studies, the mean plasma half-Iife of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10 mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%). Metabolism Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8 and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10 mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast sodium in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast were not evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients. Males and Female Patients The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar in males and females. Race Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Adolescents and Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 4 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age, the 5-mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age, and the 10 mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents \\u226515 years of age. The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10 mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents \\u226515 years of age and young adults. The 10 mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients \\u226515 years of age. The mean systemic exposure of the 4-mg chewable tablet in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age and the 5 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age is similar to the mean systemic exposure of the 10 mg film-coated tablet in adults. The 5 mg chewable tablet should be used in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age and the 4 mg chewable tablet should be used in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age. In children 6 to 11 months of age, the systemic exposure to montelukast and the variability of plasma montelukast concentrations were higher than those observed in adults. Based on population analyses, the mean AUC (4296 ng\\u2022hr/mL [range 1200 to 7153]) was 60% higher and the mean Cmax (667 ng/mL [range 201 to 1058]) was 89% higher than those observed in adults (mean AUC 2689 ng\\u2022hr/mL [range 1521 to 4595]) and mean C max (353 ng/mL [range 180 to 548]). The systemic exposure in children 12 to 23 months of age was less variable, but was still higher than that observed in adults. The mean AUC (3574 ng\\u2022hr/mL [range 2229 to 5408]) was 33% higher and the mean Cmax (562 ng/mL [range 296 to 814]) was 60% higher than those observed in adults. Safety and tolerability of montelukast in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in 26 children 6 to 23 months of age were similar to that of patients two years and above [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The 4 mg oral granule formulation should be used for pediatric patients 12 to 23 months of age for the treatment of asthma, or for pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis. Since the 4 mg oral granule formulation is bioequivalent to the 4 mg chewable tablet, it can also be used as an alternative formulation to the 4 mg chewable tablet in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline, Prednisone, and Prednisolone Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, and prednisolone. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline [predominantly a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 substrate]. Montelukast at doses of \\u2265100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone. Oral Contraceptives, Terfenadine, Digoxin, and Warfarin In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), digoxin, and warfarin. Montelukast at doses of \\u2265100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not change the plasma concentration profile of fexofenadine, did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30 mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines, and Decongestants Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast sodium was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzyme Inducers Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10 mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for montelukast sodium is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent CYP enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast sodium. Effect of Montelukast on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 in vivo . Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide) .Based on further in vitro results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzyme Inhibitors In vitro studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4. Co-administration of montelukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, resulted in no significant increase in the systemic exposure of montelukast. Data from a clinical drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8 and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold. Co-administration of itraconazole, gemfibrozil, and montelukast did not further increase the systemic exposure of montelukast. Based on available clinical experience, no dosage adjustment of montelukast is required upon co-administration with gemfibrozil [see Overdosage ( 10 ) ].\"\n",

            "        \"12.1 Mechanism of Action The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , LTE 4 ) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT 1 ) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT 1 receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or \\u03b2-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD 4 at the CysLT 1 receptor without any agonist activity.\"\n",

            "        \"12.2 Pharmacodynamics Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD 4 in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD 4 -induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively. The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known [see Clinical Studies (14) ].\"\n",

            "        \"12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 10 mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (Cmax) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T max ). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and Cmax are not influenced by a standard meal in the morning. For the 5 mg chewable tablet, the mean C max is achieved in 2 to 2.5 hours after administration to adults in the fasted state. The mean oral bioavailability is 73% in the fasted state versus 63% when administered with a standard meal in the morning. For the 4 mg chewable tablet, the mean C max is achieved 2 hours after administration in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age in the fasted state. The 4 mg oral granule formulation is bioequivalent to the 4 mg chewable tablet when administered to adults in the fasted state. The safety and effectiveness of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10 mg film-coated tablet and 5 mg chewable tablet formulations were administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma was also demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 4 mg chewable tablet and 4 mg oral granule formulations were administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and effectiveness of montelukast sodium in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10 mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5 mg chewable tablets versus one 10 mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated. Distribution Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Orally administered montelukast distributes into the brain in rats. Elimination The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and <0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile. In several studies, the mean plasma half-Iife of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10 mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%). Metabolism Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8 and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10 mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast sodium in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast were not evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients. Males and Female Patients The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar in males and females. Race Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Adolescents and Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 4 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age, the 5-mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age, and the 10 mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents \\u226515 years of age. The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10 mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents \\u226515 years of age and young adults. The 10 mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients \\u226515 years of age. The mean systemic exposure of the 4-mg chewable tablet in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age and the 5 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age is similar to the mean systemic exposure of the 10 mg film-coated tablet in adults. The 5 mg chewable tablet should be used in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age and the 4 mg chewable tablet should be used in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age. In children 6 to 11 months of age, the systemic exposure to montelukast and the variability of plasma montelukast concentrations were higher than those observed in adults. Based on population analyses, the mean AUC (4296 ng\\u2022hr/mL [range 1200 to 7153]) was 60% higher and the mean Cmax (667 ng/mL [range 201 to 1058]) was 89% higher than those observed in adults (mean AUC 2689 ng\\u2022hr/mL [range 1521 to 4595]) and mean C max (353 ng/mL [range 180 to 548]). The systemic exposure in children 12 to 23 months of age was less variable, but was still higher than that observed in adults. The mean AUC (3574 ng\\u2022hr/mL [range 2229 to 5408]) was 33% higher and the mean Cmax (562 ng/mL [range 296 to 814]) was 60% higher than those observed in adults. Safety and tolerability of montelukast in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in 26 children 6 to 23 months of age were similar to that of patients two years and above [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The 4 mg oral granule formulation should be used for pediatric patients 12 to 23 months of age for the treatment of asthma, or for pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis. Since the 4 mg oral granule formulation is bioequivalent to the 4 mg chewable tablet, it can also be used as an alternative formulation to the 4 mg chewable tablet in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline, Prednisone, and Prednisolone Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, and prednisolone. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline [predominantly a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 substrate]. Montelukast at doses of \\u2265100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone. Oral Contraceptives, Terfenadine, Digoxin, and Warfarin In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), digoxin, and warfarin. Montelukast at doses of \\u2265100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not change the plasma concentration profile of fexofenadine, did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30 mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines, and Decongestants Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast sodium was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzyme Inducers Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10 mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for montelukast sodium is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent CYP enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast sodium. Effect of Montelukast on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 in vivo . Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide) .Based on further in vitro results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzyme Inhibitors In vitro studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4. Co-administration of montelukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, resulted in no significant increase in the systemic exposure of montelukast. Data from a clinical drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8 and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold. Co-administration of itraconazole, gemfibrozil, and montelukast did not further increase the systemic exposure of montelukast. Based on available clinical experience, no dosage adjustment of montelukast is required upon co-administration with gemfibrozil [see Overdosage ( 10 ) ].\"\n",

The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with montelukast sodium, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The median age was 33 years (range 15 to 85); 56.8% were females and 43.2% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in these studies was 71.6% Caucasian, 17.7% Hispanic, 7.2% other origins and 3.5% Black. Patients had mild or moderate asthma and were non-smokers who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled \\u03b2-agonist per day on an \\\"as-needed\\\" basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) of 66% (approximate range, 40 to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV 1 and daytime asthma symptoms. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving montelukast sodium was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects. The results of the U.S. trial on the primary endpoint, morning FEV 1 , expressed as mean percent change from baseline averaged over the 12-week treatment period, are shown in FIGURE 2. Compared with placebo, treatment with one montelukast sodium 10 mg (montelukast) tablet daily in the evening resulted in a statistically significant increase in FEV 1 percent change from baseline (13%-change in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2%-change in the placebo group, p<0.001); the change from baseline in FEV 1 for montelukast sodium was 0.32 liters compared with 0.10 liters for placebo, corresponding to a between-group difference of 0.22 liters (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.17 liters, 0.27 liters). The results of the Multinational trial on FEV 1 were similar. Figure 2: FEV 1 Mean Percent Change from Baseline (U.S. Trial: Montelukast sodium N=406; Placebo N=270) (ANOVA Model) The effect of montelukast sodium on other primary and secondary endpoints, represented by the Multinational study is shown in TABLE 6.

In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p =0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001).In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p =0.196). Onset of Action and Maintenance of Effects In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, \\\"as-needed\\\" \\u03b2-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non-placebo- controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma. Pediatric Patients 6 to 14 Years of Age with Asthma The efficacy of montelukast sodium in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age was demonstrated in one 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 336 patients (201 treated with montelukast sodium and 135 treated with placebo) using an inhaled \\u03b2-agonist on an \\\"as-needed\\\" basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent predicted FEV 1 of 72% (approximate range, 45 to 90%) and a mean daily inhaled \\u03b2-agonist requirement of 3.4 puffs of albuterol. Approximately 36% of the patients were on inhaled corticosteroids. The median age was 11 years (range 6 to 15); 35.4% were females and 64.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 80.1% Caucasian, 12.8% Black, 4.5% Hispanic, and 2.7% other origins. Compared with placebo, treatment with one 5 mg montelukast sodium (montelukast) chewable tablet daily resulted in a significant improvementin mean morning FEV 1 percent change from baseline (8.7% in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2% change from baseline in the placebo group, p<0.001). There was a significant decrease in the mean percentage change in daily \\\"as-needed\\\" inhaled \\u03b2-agonist use (11.7% decrease from baseline in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 8.2% increase from baseline in the placebo group, p<0.05). This effect represents a mean decrease from baseline of 0.56 and 0.23 puffs per day for the montelukast and placebo groups, respectively. Subgroup analyses indicated that younger pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 had efficacy results comparable to those of the older pediatric patients aged 12 to 14. Similar to the adult studies, no significant change in the treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily administration in one open-label extension trial without a concurrent placebo group for up to 6 months. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age with Asthma The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age was explored in a 12-week, placebo-controlled safety and tolerability study in 689 patients, 461 of whom were treated with montelukast sodium. The median age was 4 years (range 2 to 6); 41.5% were females and 58.5% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 56.5% Caucasian, 20.9% Hispanic, 14.4% other origins, and 8.3% Black. While the primary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of montelukast sodium in this age group, the study included exploratory efficacy evaluations, including daytime and overnight asthma symptom scores, \\u03b2-agonist use, oral corticosteroid rescue, and the physician's global evaluation. The findings of these exploratory efficacy evaluations, along with pharmacokinetics and extrapolation of efficacy data from older patients, support the overall conclusion that montelukast sodium is efficacious in the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 2 to 5 years of age. Effects in Patients on Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroids Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly. One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEV 1 of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), f1unisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), f1uticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p\\u22640.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV 1 compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast sodium alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV 1 , daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and \\\"as-needed\\\" \\u03b2-agonist requirements. In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . 14.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (Adults, Adolescents, and Pediatric Patients 6 years of age and older) The efficacy of montelukast sodium 10 mg, (montelukast) when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours, and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast sodium 10 mg (montelukast) or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV 1 following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B, and Study C). In Study A, a single dose of montelukast sodium 10 mg (montelukast) demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise. Some patients were protected from EIB at 8.5 and 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. The results for the mean maximum percent fall at each timepoint in Study A are shown in TABLE 7 and are representative of the results from the other two studies. Table 7: Mean Maximum Percent Fall in FEV1 Following Exercise Challenge in Study A (N=47) ANOVA Model Time of exercise challenge following medication administration Mean Maximum percent fall in FEV 1 * Treatment difference % for montelukast sodium versus Placebo (95%Cl)* Montelukast Sodium Placebo 2 hours 13 22 -9 (-12, -5) 8.5 hours 12 17 -5 (-9, -2) 24 hours 10 14 -4 (-7, -1) *Least squares-mean The efficacy of montelukast sodium 5 mg chewable tablets, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB, was investigated in one multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study that included a total of 64 pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast sodium 5 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV 1 following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge. A single dose of montelukast sodium 5 mg demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise (TABLE 8). Similar results were shown at 24 hours post-dose (a secondary endpoint). Some patients were protected from EIB at 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. No timepoints were assessed between 2 and 24 hours post-dose.

Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study of 110 adult and adolescent asthmatics 15 years of age and older, with a mean baseline FEV 1 percent of predicted of 83% and with documented exercise-induced exacerbation of asthma, treatment with montelukast sodium, 10 mg, (montelukast) once daily in the evening, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean maximal percent fall in FEV 1 and mean time to recovery to within 5% of the pre-exercise FEV 1 . Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. Montelukast sodium did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent fall in FEV 1 after exercise (i.e., \\u226520% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied. In a separate crossover study in adults, a similar effect was observed after two once-daily 10-mg doses of montelukast sodium (montelukast). In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age, using the 5-mg chewable tablet, a 2-day crossover study demonstrated effects similar to those observed in adults when exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). 14.3 Allergic Rhinitis (Seasonal and Perennial) Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry. The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change\\u00b7 from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast sodium 10-mg (montelukast) tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black, and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast sodium tablets, loratadine, and placebo are shown in TABLE 9. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening. Table 9: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo- and Active-controlled Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) Treatment Group (N) Baseline Mean Score Mean Change from Baseline Difference Between Treatment and Placebo (95% CI) Least-Squares Mean Montelukast Sodium 10 mg (montelukast) (344) 2.09 -0.39 -0.13 \\u2020 (-0.21, -0.06) Placebo(351) 2.10 -0.26 N.A.

Perennial Allergic Rhinitis\\u00b7 The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis was investigated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in North America and Europe. The two studies enrolled a total of 3,357 patients, of whom 1,632 received montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets (montelukast). Patients 15 to 82 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis as confirmed by history and a positive skin test to at least one relevant perennial allergen (dust mites, animal dander, and/or mold spores), who had active symptoms at the time of study entry, were enrolled. In the study in which efficacy was demonstrated, the median age was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 64.1% were females and 35.9% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.2% Caucasian, 8.1% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 2.3% Asian, and 1% other origins. Montelukast sodium 10-mg (montelukast) tablets once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period (TABLE 10); in this study the primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing). Table 10: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo-controlled Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) Treatment Group (N) BaselineMean Score Mean Change from Baseline Difference Between Treatment and Placebo (95% Cl) Least-Squares Mean Montelukast Sodium10 mg (montelukast) (1000) 2.09 -0.42 -0.08 \\u2020 (-0.12, -0.04) Placebo(980) 2.10 -0.35 N.A. * Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. \\u2020 Statistically different from placebo (p\\u22640.001). The other 6-week study evaluated montelukast sodium 10 mg (montelukast) (n=626), placebo (n=609), and an active-control (cetirizine 10 mg; n=120). The primary analysis compared the mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score for montelukast sodium vs. placebo over the first 4 weeks of treatment; the study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active-control. The primary outcome variable included nasal itching in addition to nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. The estimated difference between montelukast sodium and placebo was -0.04 with a 95% CI of(-0.09, 0.01). The estimated difference between the active-control and placebo was -0.10 with a 95% CI of (-0.19, -0.01).\"\n",

Montelukast sodium is a prescription medicine that blocks substances in the body called leukotrienes. This may help to improve symptoms of asthma and inflammation of the lining of the nose (allergic rhinitis). Montelukast sodium does not contain a steroid. Montelukast sodium is used to: 1. Prevent asthma attacks and for the long-term treatment of asthma in adults and children ages 2 years and older. Do not take montelukast sodium if you need relief right away for a sudden asthma attack. If you have an asthma attack, you should follow the instructions your healthcare provider gave you for treating asthma attacks. 2. Prevent exercise-induced asthma in people 6 years of age and older. 3. Help control the symptoms of allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose, and itching of the nose. Montelukast sodium is used to treat the following in people who have already taken other medicines that did not work well enough or in people who could not tolerate other medicines: \\u2022 outdoor allergies that happen part of the year (seasonal allergic rhinitis) in adults and children ages 2 years and older, and \\u2022 indoor allergies that happen all year (perennial allergic rhinitis) in adults and children ages 2 years and older.

Recommended Dose and Schedule The recommended dose for bicalutamide therapy in combination with an LHRH analog is one 50 mg tablet once daily (morning or evening), with or without food. It is recommended that bicalutamide tablets be taken at the same time each day. Treatment with bicalutamide tablets should be started at the same time as treatment with an LHRH analog. If a dose of bicalutamide tablets is missed, take the next dose at the scheduled time. Do not take the missed dose and do not double the next dose. 2.2. Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 2.3. Dosage Adjustment in Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe liver impairment (n=4), although there was a 76% increase in the half-life (5.9 and 10.4 days for normal and impaired patients, respectively) of the active enantiomer of bicalutamide no dosage adjustment is necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\"\n",

Monitor serum transaminase levels prior to starting treatment with bicalutamide, at regular intervals for the first four months of treatment and periodically thereafter, and for symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. Use bicalutamide with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. (5.1) Hemorrhage with Concomitant Use of Coumarin Anticoagulant. Closely monitor the Prothrombin Time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR), and adjust the anticoagulant dose as needed. (5.2) Gynecomastia and breast pain have been reported during treatment with bicalutamide 150 mg when used as a single agent. (5.3) Bicalutamide is used in combination with an LHRH agonist. LHRH agonists have been shown to cause a reduction in glucose tolerance in males. Consideration should be given to monitoring blood glucose in patients receiving bicalutamide in combination with LHRH agonists. (5.4) Monitoring Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is recommended. Evaluate for clinical progression if PSA increases. (5.5) 5.1. Hepatitis Cases of death or hospitalization due to severe liver injury (hepatic failure) have been reported postmarketing in association with the use of bicalutamide tablets. Hepatotoxicity in these reports generally occurred within the first three to four months of treatment. Hepatitis or marked increases in liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation occurred in approximately 1% of bicalutamide tablet patients in controlled clinical trials. Serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to starting treatment with bicalutamide tablets, at regular intervals for the first four months of treatment, and periodically thereafter. If clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction occur (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, \\u201cflu-like\\u201d symptoms, dark urine, jaundice, or right upper quadrant tenderness), the serum transaminases, in particular the serum ALT, should be measured immediately. If at any time a patient has jaundice, or their ALT rises above two times the upper limit of normal, bicalutamide tablets should be immediately discontinued with close follow-up of liver function. 5.2. Hemorrhage with Concomitant Use of Coumarin Anticoagulant In the postmarketing setting, there have been reports of excessive prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) days to weeks after the introduction of bicalutamide in patients who were previously stable on coumarin anticoagulants. Some patients had serious bleeding including intracranial, retroperitoneal, and gastrointestinal requiring blood transfusion and/or administration of vitamin K. Closely monitor the PT/INR, and adjust the anticoagulant dose as needed [see Drug Interactions (7) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.3. Gynecomastia and Breast Pain In clinical trials with bicalutamide 150 mg as a single agent for prostate cancer, gynecomastia and breast pain have been reported in up to 38% and 39% of patients, respectively. 5.4. Glucose Tolerance A reduction in glucose tolerance has been observed in males receiving LHRH agonists. This may manifest as diabetes or loss of glycemic control in those with pre-existing diabetes. Consideration should therefore be given to monitoring blood glucose in patients receiving bicalutamide in combination with LHRH agonists. 5.5. Laboratory Tests Regular assessments of serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) may be helpful in monitoring the patient\\u2019s response. If PSA levels rise during bicalutamide therapy, the patient should be evaluated for clinical progression. For patients who have objective progression of disease together with an elevated PSA, a treatment-free period of antiandrogen, while continuing the LHRH analog, may be considered.\"\n",

ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions that occurred in more than 10% of patients receiving bicalutamide plus an LHRH-A were: hot flashes, pain (including general, back, pelvic and abdominal), asthenia, constipation, infection, nausea, peripheral edema, dyspnea, diarrhea, hematuria, nocturia, and anemia.

Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of bicalutamide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease (some fatal) including interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, most often at doses greater than 50 mg. Hemorrhage: Increased PT/INR due to interaction between coumarin anticoagulants and bicalutamide. Serious bleeding reported.

            "        \"7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Clinical studies have not shown any drug interactions between bicalutamide and LHRH analogs (goserelin or leuprolide). There is no evidence that bicalutamide induces hepatic enzymes. In vitro studies have shown that R-bicalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4 with lesser inhibitory effects on CYP 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 activity. Clinical studies have shown that with co-administration of bicalutamide, mean midazolam (a CYP 3A4 substrate) levels may be increased 1.5-fold (for C max ) and 1.9-fold (for AUC). Hence, caution should be exercised when bicalutamide is co-administered with CYP 3A4 substrates. In vitro protein binding studies have shown that bicalutamide can displace coumarin anticoagulants from binding sites. PT/INR should be closely monitored in patients concomitantly receiving coumarin anticoagulants and bicalutamide. Adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. R-bicalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4; therefore, caution should be used when bicalutamide is co-administered with CYP 3A4 substrates. (7) PT/INR should be closely monitored in patients already receiving coumarin anticoagulants who are started on bicalutamide. (7)\"\n",

(8.3) Pediatric patients: Efficacy has not been demonstrated for the treatment of familial male-limited precocious puberty (testotoxicosis). (8.4) 8.1. Pregnancy Risk Summary Bicalutamide tablets are contraindicated for use in pregnant women because it can cause fetal harm. Bicalutamide tablets are not indicated for use in females. There are no human data on the use of bicalutamide tablets in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of bicalutamide to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused abnormal development of reproductive organs in male fetuses at exposures approximately 0.7 to 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose ( see Data ). Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-15, male fetuses had reduced anogenital distance at doses of 10 mg/kg/day and above (approximately 0.7 to 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose). In a pre- and post-natal development study, female rats were dosed from gestation day 7-16 and allowed to litter and rear their offspring to weaning. Male offspring of rats receiving doses of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) and above, were observed to have reduced anogenital distance. In a peri- and post-natal development study, female rats were dosed from gestation day 16 to lactation day 22 and allowed to litter and rear their offspring to weaning. Survival and weights of offspring during lactation were reduced for litters from maternal rats receiving doses of 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose). Male offspring of rats receiving doses of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) and above, were observed to have reduced anogenital distance, smaller secondary sex organs, cryptorchidism and hypospadias resulting in an inability to mate and impregnate their female partners. Female offspring of rats receiving doses of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) and above had reduced pregnancy rates. 8.2. Lactation Risk Summary Bicalutamide tablets are is not indicated for use in pregnant women. There is no information available on the presence of bicalutamide in human milk, or on the effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Bicalutamide has been detected in rat milk. 8.3. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Males Antiandrogen therapy may cause morphological changes in spermatozoa [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Based on findings in animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 130 days after the final dose of bicalutamide tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Infertility Males Based on animal studies, bicalutamide can lead to inhibition of spermatogenesis and may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. The long-term effects of bicalutamide on male fertility have not been studied [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of bicalutamide tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Bicalutamide orodispersible tablet was studied in combination with anastrozole orodispersible tablet in an open-label, non-comparative, multi-center study that assessed the efficacy and safety of this combination regimen over 12 months in the treatment of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in boys with familial male-limited precocious puberty, also known as testotoxicosis. Patients were enrolled in the study if they had a baseline age \\u22652 years and a diagnosis of testotoxicosis based on clinical features of progressive precocious puberty, symmetrical testicular enlargement, advanced bone age, pubertal levels of serum testosterone, prepubertal pattern of gonadotropin secretion following a GnRH stimulation test, and absence of other clinical and biochemical causes of testosterone excess. Thirteen out of the 14 patients enrolled completed 12 months of combination treatment (one patient was lost to follow-up). If central precocious puberty (CPP) developed an LHRH analog was to be added. Four patients were diagnosed with CPP during the 12-month study and received LHRH analog treatment and 2 additional patients were diagnosed at the end of the 12 months and received treatment subsequently. Mean \\u00b1 SD characteristics at baseline were as follows: chronological age: 3.9\\u00b11.9 years; bone age 8.8\\u00b12.5; bone age/chronological age ratio: 2.06\\u00b10.51; growth rate (cm/yr): 10.81\\u00b14.22; growth rate standard deviation score (SDS): 0.41\\u00b11.36. The starting bicalutamide dose was 12.5 mg. Bicalutamide was titrated in each patient until steady-state R-bicalutamide (the active isomer of bicalutamide) trough plasma concentration reached 5-15 mcg/mL, which is the range of therapeutic concentrations achieved in adults with prostate cancer following the administration of the currently approved bicalutamide dose of 50 mg. The starting daily dose of anastrozole was 0.5 mg. Anastrozole was independently titrated in each patient until it reached at steady-state a serum estradiol concentration of <10 pmol/L (2.7 pg/mL). The following ascending doses were used for bicalutamide: 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. For anastrozole there were two ascending doses: 0.5 mg and 1 mg. At the end of the titration phase, 1 patient was on 12.5 mg bicalutamide, 8 patients were on 50 mg bicalutamide, and 4 patients were on 100 mg bicalutamide; 10 patients were on 0.5 mg anastrozole and 3 patients were on 1 mg anastrozole. In the majority of patients, steady-state trough concentrations of R-bicalutamide appeared to be attained by Day 21 with once daily dosing. Steady-state trough plasma anastrozole concentrations appeared to be attained by Day 8. The primary efficacy analysis of the study was to assess the change in growth rate after 12 months of treatment, relative to the growth rate during the \\u22656 months prior to entering the study. Pre-study growth rates were obtained retrospectively. There was no statistical evidence that the growth rate was reduced during treatment. During bicalutamide/anastrozole treatment the mean growth rate (cm/yr) decreased by 1.6 cm/year, 95% CI (-4.7 to 1.5) p=0.28; the mean growth rate SDS decreased by 0.1 SD, 95% CI (-1.2 to 1.0) p=0.88. Table 2 shows descriptive data for growth rates for the overall population and for subgroups defined by history of previous treatment for testotoxicosis with ketoconazole, spironolactone, anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors.

PT = Previous treatment for testotoxicosis with ketoconazole, spironolactone, anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors. Median calculated as midpoint of 3 rd and 4 th ranked observations. NPT = no previous treatment for testotoxicosis with ketoconazole, spironolactone, anastrozole, or other aromatase inhibitors. Total testosterone concentrations increased by a mean of 5 mmol/L over the 12 months of treatment from a baseline mean of 10 mmol/L. Estradiol concentrations were at or below the level of quantification (9.81 pmol/L) for 11 of 12 patients after 12 months of treatment. Six of the 12 patients started treatment at an estradiol concentration below the level of quantification. There were no deaths, serious adverse events, or discontinuations due to adverse events during the study. Of the 14 patients exposed to study treatment, 13 (92.9%) experienced at least one adverse event. The most frequently reported (>3 patients) adverse events were gynecomastia (7/14, 50%), central precocious puberty (6/14, 43%), vomiting (5/14, 36%), headache (3/14, 21%), pyrexia (3/14, 21%), and upper respiratory tract infection (3/14, 21%). Adverse reactions considered possibly related to bicalutamide by investigators included gynecomastia (6/14, 43%), central precocious puberty (2/14, 14%), breast tenderness (2/14, 14%), breast pain (1/14, 7%), asthenia (1/14, 7%), increased alanine aminotransferase [ALT] (1/14, 7%), increased aspartate aminotransferase [AST] (1/14, 7%), and musculoskeletal chest pain (1/14, 7%). Headache was the only adverse reaction considered possibly related to anastrozole by investigators. For the patient who developed elevated ALT and AST, the elevation was <3X ULN, and returned to normal without stopping treatment; there was no concomitant elevation in total bilirubin. 8.5. Geriatric Use In two studies in patients given 50 or 150 mg daily, no significant relationship between age and steady-state levels of total bicalutamide or the active R-enantiomer has been shown. 8.6. Hepatic Impairment Bicalutamide tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment. Bicalutamide is extensively metabolized by the liver. Limited data in subjects with severe hepatic impairment suggest that excretion of bicalutamide may be delayed and could lead to further accumulation. Periodic liver function tests should be considered for hepatic-impaired patients on long-term therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. No clinically significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of either enantiomer of bicalutamide was noted in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic disease as compared to healthy controls. However, the half-life of the R-enantiomer was increased approximately 76% (5.9 and 10.4 days for normal and impaired patients, respectively) in patients with severe liver disease (n=4). 8.7. Renal Impairment Renal impairment (as measured by creatinine clearance) had no significant effect on the elimination of total bicalutamide or the active R-enantiomer.\"\n",

Bicalutamide tablets are not indicated for use in females. There are no human data on the use of bicalutamide tablets in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of bicalutamide to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused abnormal development of reproductive organs in male fetuses at exposures approximately 0.7 to 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose ( see Data ). Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-15, male fetuses had reduced anogenital distance at doses of 10 mg/kg/day and above (approximately 0.7 to 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose). In a pre- and post-natal development study, female rats were dosed from gestation day 7-16 and allowed to litter and rear their offspring to weaning. Male offspring of rats receiving doses of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) and above, were observed to have reduced anogenital distance. In a peri- and post-natal development study, female rats were dosed from gestation day 16 to lactation day 22 and allowed to litter and rear their offspring to weaning. Survival and weights of offspring during lactation were reduced for litters from maternal rats receiving doses of 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose). Male offspring of rats receiving doses of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) and above, were observed to have reduced anogenital distance, smaller secondary sex organs, cryptorchidism and hypospadias resulting in an inability to mate and impregnate their female partners. Female offspring of rats receiving doses of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) and above had reduced pregnancy rates.\"\n",

Bicalutamide orodispersible tablet was studied in combination with anastrozole orodispersible tablet in an open-label, non-comparative, multi-center study that assessed the efficacy and safety of this combination regimen over 12 months in the treatment of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in boys with familial male-limited precocious puberty, also known as testotoxicosis. Patients were enrolled in the study if they had a baseline age \\u22652 years and a diagnosis of testotoxicosis based on clinical features of progressive precocious puberty, symmetrical testicular enlargement, advanced bone age, pubertal levels of serum testosterone, prepubertal pattern of gonadotropin secretion following a GnRH stimulation test, and absence of other clinical and biochemical causes of testosterone excess. Thirteen out of the 14 patients enrolled completed 12 months of combination treatment (one patient was lost to follow-up). If central precocious puberty (CPP) developed an LHRH analog was to be added. Four patients were diagnosed with CPP during the 12-month study and received LHRH analog treatment and 2 additional patients were diagnosed at the end of the 12 months and received treatment subsequently. Mean \\u00b1 SD characteristics at baseline were as follows: chronological age: 3.9\\u00b11.9 years; bone age 8.8\\u00b12.5; bone age/chronological age ratio: 2.06\\u00b10.51; growth rate (cm/yr): 10.81\\u00b14.22; growth rate standard deviation score (SDS): 0.41\\u00b11.36. The starting bicalutamide dose was 12.5 mg. Bicalutamide was titrated in each patient until steady-state R-bicalutamide (the active isomer of bicalutamide) trough plasma concentration reached 5-15 mcg/mL, which is the range of therapeutic concentrations achieved in adults with prostate cancer following the administration of the currently approved bicalutamide dose of 50 mg. The starting daily dose of anastrozole was 0.5 mg. Anastrozole was independently titrated in each patient until it reached at steady-state a serum estradiol concentration of <10 pmol/L (2.7 pg/mL). The following ascending doses were used for bicalutamide: 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. For anastrozole there were two ascending doses: 0.5 mg and 1 mg. At the end of the titration phase, 1 patient was on 12.5 mg bicalutamide, 8 patients were on 50 mg bicalutamide, and 4 patients were on 100 mg bicalutamide; 10 patients were on 0.5 mg anastrozole and 3 patients were on 1 mg anastrozole. In the majority of patients, steady-state trough concentrations of R-bicalutamide appeared to be attained by Day 21 with once daily dosing. Steady-state trough plasma anastrozole concentrations appeared to be attained by Day 8. The primary efficacy analysis of the study was to assess the change in growth rate after 12 months of treatment, relative to the growth rate during the \\u22656 months prior to entering the study. Pre-study growth rates were obtained retrospectively. There was no statistical evidence that the growth rate was reduced during treatment. During bicalutamide/anastrozole treatment the mean growth rate (cm/yr) decreased by 1.6 cm/year, 95% CI (-4.7 to 1.5) p=0.28; the mean growth rate SDS decreased by 0.1 SD, 95% CI (-1.2 to 1.0) p=0.88.

            "        \"12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1. Mechanism of Action Bicalutamide is a non-steroidal androgen receptor inhibitor. It competitively inhibits the action of androgens by binding to cytosol androgen receptors in the target tissue. Prostatic carcinoma is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to treatment that counteracts the effect of androgen and/or removes the source of androgen. When bicalutamide is combined with LHRH analog therapy, the suppression of serum testosterone induced by the LHRH analog is not affected. However, in clinical trials with bicalutamide as a single agent for prostate cancer, rises in serum testosterone and estradiol have been noted. In a subset of patients who have been treated with bicalutamide and an LHRH agonist, and who discontinue bicalutamide therapy due to progressive advanced prostate cancer, a reduction in Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and/or clinical improvement (antiandrogen withdrawal phenomenon) may be observed. 12.3. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bicalutamide is well-absorbed following oral administration, although the absolute bioavailability is unknown. Co-administration of bicalutamide with food has no clinically significant effect on rate or extent of absorption. Distribution Bicalutamide is highly protein-bound (96%) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Metabolism/Elimination Bicalutamide undergoes stereospecific metabolism. The S (inactive) isomer is metabolized primarily by glucuronidation. The R (active) isomer also undergoes glucuronidation but is predominantly oxidized to an inactive metabolite followed by glucuronidation. Both the parent and metabolite glucuronides are eliminated in the urine and feces. The S-enantiomer is rapidly cleared relative to the R-enantiomer, with the R-enantiomer accounting for about 99% of total steady-state plasma levels. Pharmacokinetics of the active enantiomer of bicalutamide in normal males and patients with prostate cancer are presented in Table 3. Table 3.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in both male and female rats and mice at doses of 5, 15 or 75 mg/kg/day of bicalutamide. A variety of tumor target organ effects were identified and were attributed to the antiandrogenicity of bicalutamide, namely, testicular benign interstitial (Leydig) cell tumors in male rats at all dose levels (the steady-state plasma concentration with the 5 mg/kg/day dose is approximately 0.7 times the human exposure a the recommended dose) and uterine adenocarcinoma in female rats at 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the human exposure at the recommended dose). There is no evidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia in patients; uterine tumors are not relevant to the indicated patient population. A small increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in male mice given 75 mg/kg/day of bicalutamide (approximately 4 times human exposure at the recommended dose) and an increased incidence of benign thyroid follicular cell adenomas in rats given 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) and above were recorded. These neoplastic changes were progressions of non-neoplastic changes related to hepatic enzyme induction observed in animal toxicity studies. Enzyme induction has not been observed following bicalutamide administration in man. There were no tumorigenic effects suggestive of genotoxic carcinogenesis. A comprehensive battery of both in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests (yeast gene conversion, Ames, E. coli , CHO/HGPRT, human lymphocyte cytogenetic, mouse micronucleus, and rat bone marrow cytogenetic tests) has demonstrated that bicalutamide does not have genotoxic activity. In repeat-dose toxicology studies, atrophy of seminiferous tubules of the testes has been observed for all species examined, which is a predicted class effect with antiandrogens. In the 6- and 12-month rat study, testicular atrophy was seen at approximately 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. In the 12-month dog study, the incidence of testicular atrophy was seen at approximately 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. In male rats administered 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times human exposure at the recommended dose), the precoital interval and time to successful mating were increased in the first pairing, but no effects on fertility following successful mating were seen. These effects were reversed by 7 weeks after the end of an 11 week period of dosing. Female rats dosed at 1, 10 and 250 mg/kg/day (less than to 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) had increased estrous cycle irregularity but there was no effect on fertility. In a peri- and post-natal development study, female offspring of rats receiving doses of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose) and above had reduced pregnancy rates. Administration of bicalutamide to pregnant females resulted in feminization of the male offspring leading to hypospadias at doses of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) and above. Affected male offspring were also impotent.\"\n",

Bicalutamide 50 mg Daily in Combination with an LHRH-A In a multi-center, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 813 patients with previously untreated advanced prostate cancer were randomized to receive bicalutamide 50 mg once daily (404 patients) or flutamide 250 mg (409 patients) three times a day, each in combination with LHRH analogs (either goserelin acetate implant or leuprolide acetate depot). In an analysis conducted after a median follow-up of 160 weeks was reached, 213 (52.7%) patients treated with bicalutamide-LHRH analog therapy and 235 (57.5%) patients treated with flutamide-LHRH analog therapy had died. There was no significant difference in survival between treatment groups (see Figure 1). The hazard ratio for time to death (survival) was 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.05). Figure 1 - The Kaplan-Meier probability of death for both antiandrogen treatment groups. There was no significant difference in time to objective tumor progression between treatment groups (see Figure 2). Objective tumor progression was defined as the appearance of any bone metastases or the worsening of any existing bone metastases on bone scan attributable to metastatic disease, or an increase by 25% or more of any existing measurable extraskeletal metastases. The hazard ratio for time to progression of bicalutamide plus LHRH analog to that of flutamide plus LHRH analog was 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.10). Figure 2 - Kaplan-Meier curve for time to progression for both antiandrogen treatment groups. Quality of life was assessed with self-administered patient questionnaires on pain, social functioning, emotional well-being, vitality, activity limitation, bed disability, overall health, physical capacity, general symptoms, and treatment related symptoms. Assessment of the Quality of Life questionnaires did not indicate consistent significant differences between the two treatment groups. Figure-1 Figure-2 14.2. Safety Data from Clinical Studies using Bicalutamide 150 mg Bicalutamide 150 mg is not approved for use either alone or with other treatments. Two identical multi-center, randomized, open-label trials comparing bicalutamide 150 mg daily monotherapy to castration were conducted in patients that had locally advanced (T3-4, NX, M0) or metastatic (M1) prostate cancer. Monotherapy \\u2013 M1 Group Bicalutamide 150 mg daily is not approved for use in patients with M1 cancer of the prostate. Based on an interim analysis of the two trials for survival, the Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended that bicalutamide treatment be discontinued in the M1 patients because the risk of death was 25% (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.81) and 31% (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.77) higher in the bicalutamide treated group compared to that in the castrated group, respectively. Locally Advanced (T3-4, NX, M0) Group Bicalutamide 150 mg daily is not approved for use in patients with locally advanced (T3-4, NX, M0) cancer of the prostate. Following discontinuation of all M1 patients, the trials continued with the T3-4, NX, M0 patients until study completion. In the larger trial (N=352), the risk of death was 25% (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.71) higher in the bicalutamide group and in the smaller trial (N=140), the risk of death was 36% (HR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.03) lower in the bicalutamide group. In addition to the above two studies, there are three other ongoing clinical studies that provide additional safety information for bicalutamide 150 mg, a dose that is not approved for use. These are three multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trials comparing bicalutamide 150 mg daily monotherapy (adjuvant to previous therapy or under watchful waiting) with placebo, for death or time to disease progression, in a population of 8113 patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. Bicalutamide 150 mg daily is not approved for use as therapy for patients with localized prostate cancer who are candidates for watchful waiting. Data from a planned subgroup analysis of two of these trials in 1627 patients with localized prostate cancer who were under watchful waiting, revealed a trend toward decreased survival in the bicalutamide arm after a median follow-up of 7.4 years. There were 294 (37.7%) deaths in the bicalutamide treated patients versus 279 (32.9%) deaths in the placebo-treated patients (localized watchful waiting group) for a hazard ratio of 1.16 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.37).\"\n",

            "        \"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to intravenous (IV) administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to firstpass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available (see Table 1). When diclofenac sodium extended-release tablet are taken with food, there is a delay of 1 to 2 hours in the T max and a 2-fold increase in C max values. The extent of absorption of diclofenac, however, is not significantly affected by food intake. Table 1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Diclofenac PK Parameter Normal Healthy Adults (18 to 48 years) Mean Coefficient of Variation (%) Absolute Bioavailability (%) [N=7] 55 40 T max (hr) [N = 12] 5.3 28 Oral clearance (CL/F; mL/ min) [N = 12] 895 56 Renal clearance (% unchanged drug in urine) [N = 7] <1 - Apparent volume of Distribution (V/F; L/kg) [N = 56] 1.4 58 Terminal half-life (hr) [N = 56] 2.3 4.8 Distribution The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac sodium is 1.4 L/kg. Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15 to 105 mcg/mL) achieved with recommended doses. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4\\u2019-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3\\u2019-hydroxy-, 4\\u2019, 5-dihydroxy- and 3\\u2019-hydroxy-4\\u2019-methoxy-diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidativemetabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acyl glucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy- and 3\\u2019-hydroxy-diclofenac. In patients with renal dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4\\u2019-hydroxy- and 5-hydroxydiclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects. Excretion Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. Special Populations Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium extended- release tablets has not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Hepatic Impairment: Hepatic metabolism accounts for almost 100% of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets elimination, so patients with hepatic disease may require reduced doses of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Renal Impairment: Diclofenac pharmacokinetics has been investigated in subjects with renal insufficiency. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac have been detected in studies of patients with renal impairment. In patients with renal impairment (inulin clearance 60 to 90, 30 to 60, and less than 30 mL/min; N=6 in each group), area under the curve (AUC) values and elimination rate were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Voriconazole : When co-administered with voriconazole (inhibitor of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 enzyme), the C max and AUC of diclofenac increased by 114% and 78%, respectively ( see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ). Aspirin : When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin ( see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ).\"\n",

            "        \"WARNINGS Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events ( see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation ). Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who use NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: \\u2022 Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. \\u2022 Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time \\u2022 Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. \\u2022 Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. \\u2022 If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. \\u2022 In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding ( see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ). Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) also known as SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT [alanine aminotransferase] was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \\\"flu-like\\\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, anti-epileptics). Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs ( see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ). Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately 2-fold increase in hospitalization for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) ( see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ). Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets ( see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ). Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS; Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity ). Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma, which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). When diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse events, such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs, such as diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice ( see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy ). Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Comorbid conditions, such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding ( see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ).\"\n",

            "        \"PRECAUTIONS General Diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, USP cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids and the patient should be observed closely for any evidence of adverse effects, including adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of symptoms of arthritis. The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions. Information for Patients Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) that accompanies each prescription dispensed. Inform patients, families, or their caregivers of the following information before initiating therapy with diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events: Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately ( see WARNINGS; Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events ). Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their health care provider. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for the signs and symptoms of GI bleeding ( see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation ). Hepatotoxicity Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \\u201cflu-like\\u201d symptoms). If these occur, instruct patients to stop Diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and seek immediate medical therapy ( see WARNINGS; Hepatotoxicity ). Heart Failure and Edema: Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure, including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur ( see WARNINGS; Heart Failure and Edema ). A naphylactic Reactions Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). Instruct patients to seek immediate emergency help if these occur ( see WARNINGS; Anaphylactic Reactions ). Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS Advise patients to stop taking diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible ( see WARNINGS ; Serious Skin Reactions ). Female Fertility Advise females of reproductive potential who desire pregnancy that NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, may be associated with a reversible delay in ovulation ( see PRECAUTIONS; Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). Fetal Toxicity Inform pregnant women to avoid use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and other NSAIDs, starting at 30 weeks' gestation because of the risk of the premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours. ( see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy ). Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy ( see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation and Drug Interactions ). Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in \\u201cover the counter\\u201d medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia. Use of NSAIDS and Low-Dose Aspirin Inform patients not to use low-dose aspirin concomitantly with diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets until they talk to their healthcare provider ( see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ). Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically ( see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation, and Hepatotoxicity ). Drug Interactions See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac. Table 2. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding (see WARNINGS; Hematological Toxicity ) . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone (see Warnings; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation ) . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding (see WARNINGS; Hematological Toxicity ) . Diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta- Blockers Clinical Impact: \\u2022 NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). \\u2022 In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, coadministration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: \\u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. \\u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function (see WARNINGS; Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia ) . \\u2022 When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAIDinhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy, including antihypertensive effects (see WARNINGS; Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia ) . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation ) . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of pemetrexed. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration. CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers: Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Coadministration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac whereas coadministration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac is administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY; Pharmacokinetics ) . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats given diclofenac sodium up to 2 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, 200 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison) have revealed no significant increase in tumor incidence. A 2-year carcinogenicity study conducted in mice employing diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.007 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.02 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in females did not reveal any oncogenic potential. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium did not show mutagenic activity in in vitro point mutation assays in mammalian (mouse lymphoma) and microbial (yeast, Ames) test systems and was nonmutagenic in several mammalian in vitro and in vivo tests, including dominant lethal and male germinal epithelial chromosomal studies in mice, and nucleus anomaly and chromosomal aberration studies in Chinese hamsters. Impairment of Fertility Diclofenac sodium administered to male and female rats at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) did not affect fertility. Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy ( see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ). Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, or rabbits given diclofenac daily during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 0.5, 0.5, and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses [see Data]. Based on published animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and follow up according to clinical practice (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. Data Human Data Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these post-marketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data Reproductive and developmental studies in animals demonstrated that diclofenac sodium administration during organogenesis did not produce teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity in mice at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, 200 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison), and in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 and 1 times, respectively, the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In a study in which pregnant rats were orally administered 2 or 4 mg/kg diclofenac (0.1 and 0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA) from Gestation Day 15 through Lactation Day 21, significant maternal toxicity (peritonitis, mortality) was noted. These maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice, rats, and humans. Nursing Mothers Risk Summary Based on available data, diclofenac may be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data One woman treated orally with a diclofenac salt, 150 mg/day, had a milk diclofenac level of 100 mcg/L, equivalent to an infant dose of about 0.03 mg/kg/day. Diclofenac was not detectable in breast milk in 12 women using diclofenac (after either 100 mg/day orally for 7 days or a single 50 mg intramuscular dose administered in the immediate postpartum period). Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/ or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects ( see WARNINGS; Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events, Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation, Hepatotoxicity, Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia , PRECAUTIONS; Laboratory Monitoring ). Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , ADVERSE REACTIONS ).\"\n",

Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding (see WARNINGS; Hematological Toxicity ) . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone (see Warnings; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation ) . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding (see WARNINGS; Hematological Toxicity ) . Diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta- Blockers Clinical Impact: \\u2022 NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). \\u2022 In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, coadministration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: \\u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. \\u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function (see WARNINGS; Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia ) . \\u2022 When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAIDinhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy, including antihypertensive effects (see WARNINGS; Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia ) . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation ) . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of pemetrexed. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration. CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers: Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Coadministration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac whereas coadministration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac is administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY; Pharmacokinetics ) .\"\n",

            "        \"Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats given diclofenac sodium up to 2 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, 200 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison) have revealed no significant increase in tumor incidence. A 2-year carcinogenicity study conducted in mice employing diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.007 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.02 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in females did not reveal any oncogenic potential. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium did not show mutagenic activity in in vitro point mutation assays in mammalian (mouse lymphoma) and microbial (yeast, Ames) test systems and was nonmutagenic in several mammalian in vitro and in vivo tests, including dominant lethal and male germinal epithelial chromosomal studies in mice, and nucleus anomaly and chromosomal aberration studies in Chinese hamsters. Impairment of Fertility Diclofenac sodium administered to male and female rats at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) did not affect fertility. Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.\"\n",

            "        \"Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy ( see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ). Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, or rabbits given diclofenac daily during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 0.5, 0.5, and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses [see Data]. Based on published animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets and follow up according to clinical practice (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. Data Human Data Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these post-marketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data Reproductive and developmental studies in animals demonstrated that diclofenac sodium administration during organogenesis did not produce teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity in mice at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, 200 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison), and in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 and 1 times, respectively, the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In a study in which pregnant rats were orally administered 2 or 4 mg/kg diclofenac (0.1 and 0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA) from Gestation Day 15 through Lactation Day 21, significant maternal toxicity (peritonitis, mortality) was noted. These maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice, rats, and humans.\"\n",

( see WARNINGS; Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events, Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation, Hypertension, Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia ). Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdose (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . The use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing alprazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient\\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The continued use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .

Dosage may be increased, at intervals of every 3 to 4 days, to a maximum recommended daily dose of 4 mg, given in divided doses. Use the lowest possible effective dose and frequently assess the need for continued treatment. Panic Disorder : Recommended starting oral dosage is 0.5 mg three times daily. The dosage may be increased at intervals of every 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day. ( 2.2 ) When tapering, decrease dosage by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) See the Full Prescribing Information for the recommended dosage in geriatric patients, patients with hepatic impairment, and with use with ritonavir. ( 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Generalized Anxiety Disorder The recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets for the acute treatment of patients with GAD is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg administered three times daily. Depending upon the response, the dosage may be adjusted at intervals of every 3 to 4 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 4 mg daily (in divided doses). Use the lowest possible effective dose and frequently assess the need for continued treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 2.2 Dosage in Panic Disorder The recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets for the treatment of PD is 0.5 mg three times daily. Depending on the response, the dosage may be increased at intervals of every 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day. Controlled trials of alprazolam tablets in the treatment of panic disorder included dosages in the range of 1 mg to 10 mg daily. The mean dosage was approximately 5 mg to 6 mg daily. Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg per day. For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised. In a controlled postmarketing dose-response study, patients treated with doses of alprazolam tablets greater than 4 mg per day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit. The necessary duration of treatment for PD in patients responding to alprazolam tablets are unknown. After a period of extended freedom from panic attacks, a carefully supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted, but there is evidence that this may often be difficult to accomplish without recurrence of symptoms and/or the manifestation of withdrawal phenomena [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 2.3 Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Alprazolam Tablets To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. Reduced the dosage by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared the recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations in Geriatric Patients In geriatric patients, the recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. Geriatric patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dosage, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, the recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dose, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.6 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Alprazolam tablets should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage when a patient is started on ritonavir and alprazolam tablets together, or when ritonavir administered to a patient treated with alprazolam tablets. Increase the alprazolam tablets dosage to the target dose after 10 to 14 days of dosing ritonavir and alprazolam tablets together. It is not necessary to reduce alprazolam tablets dose in patients who have been taking ritonavir for more than 10 to 14 days. Alprazolam tablets are contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] .\"\n",

            "        \"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Effects on Driving and Operating Machinery: Patients receiving alprazolam should be cautioned against operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, as well as avoiding concomitant use of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs. ( 5.4 ) Patients with Depression: Exercise caution in patients with signs or symptoms of depression. Prescribe the least number of tablets feasible to avoid intentional overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome: Alprazolam use during pregnancy can result in neonatal sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal. ( 5.8 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe alprazolam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of alprazolam than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking alprazolam, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when alprazolam is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction The use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2) ] . Before prescribing alprazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient\\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of alprazolam, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of alprazolam along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. 5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to alprazolam. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . Even after relatively short-term use at doses of < 4 mg/day, there is some risk of dependence. Spontaneous reporting system data suggest that the risk of dependence and its severity appear to be greater in patients treated with doses greater than 4 mg/day and for long periods (more than 12 weeks). However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients who received alprazolam, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose. In contrast, patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day had more difficulty tapering to zero dose than those treated with less than 4 mg/day. In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease, and weight loss. Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal. Interdose Symptoms Early morning anxiety and emergence of anxiety symptoms between doses of alprazolam have been reported in patients with panic disorder taking prescribed maintenance doses. These symptoms may reflect the development of tolerance or a time interval between doses which is longer than the duration of clinical action of the administered dose. In either case, it is presumed that the prescribed dose is not sufficient to maintain plasma levels above those needed to prevent relapse, rebound, or withdrawal symptoms over the entire course of the interdosing interval. 5.4 Effects on Driving and Operating Machinery Because of its CNS depressant effects, patients receiving alprazolam should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. For the same reason, patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs during treatment with alprazolam [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.5 Interaction with Drugs that Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Drugs that inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Alprazolam is contraindicated in patients receiving strong inhibitors of CYP3A (such as azole antifungal agents), except ritonavir [see Contraindications (4) ]. Ketoconazole and itraconazole have been shown in vivo to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations 3.98 fold and 2.70 fold, respectively. Dosage adjustment is necessary when alprazolam and ritonavir are initiated concomitantly or when ritonavir is added to a stable dosage of alprazolam [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Drugs demonstrated to be CYP3A inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving alprazolam: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, and cimetidine [see Drug Interaction (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and consider dose reduction of alprazolam, as appropriate, during co-administration with these drugs. 5.6 Patients with Depression Benzodiazepines may worsen depression. Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients. Consequently, appropriate precautions (e.g., limiting the total prescription size and increased monitoring for suicidal ideation) should be considered in patients with depression. 5.7 Mania Episodes of hypomania and mania have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam in patients with depression [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.8 Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome Use of alprazolam late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Monitor neonates exposedtoalprazolam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly. 5.9 Risk in Patients with Impaired Respiratory Function There have been reports of death in patients with severe pulmonary disease shortly after the initiation of treatment with alprazolam. Closely monitor patients with impaired respiratory function. If signs and symptoms of respiratory depression, hypoventilation, or apnea occur, discontinue alprazolam.\"\n",

Paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, increased muscle spasticity, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, and other adverse behavioral effects such as agitation, rage, irritability, and aggressive or hostile behavior have been reported rarely. In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects, patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur, alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder, a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability, hostility, and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of alprazolam. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Endocrine disorders: Hyperprolactinemia General disorders and administration site conditions: Edema peripheral Hepatobiliary disorders: Hepatitis, hepatic failure Investigations: Liver enzyme elevations Psychiatric disorders: Hypomania, mania Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, galactorrhea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Photosensitivity reaction, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome\"\n",

            "        \"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Use with Opioids: Increase the risk of respiratory depression. ( 7.1 ) Use with Other CNS Depressants: Produces additive CNS depressant effects. ( 7.1 ) Use with Digoxin: Increase the risk of digoxin toxicity. ( 7.1 ) Use with CYP3A Inhibitors (except ritonavir): Increase the risk of adverse reactions of alprazolam. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7.1 ) Use with CYP3A Inducers: Increase the risk of reduced efficacy of alprazolam. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Alprazolam Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with alprazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Alprazolam Opioids Clinical implication The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA A ) sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Prevention or management Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of alprazolam and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Examples Morphine, buprenorphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone, alfentanil, butorpenol, codeine, dihydrocodeine, meperidine, pentazocine, remifentanil, sufentanil, tapentadol, tramadol. CNS Depressants Clinical implication The benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, produce additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with other CNS depressants. Prevention or management Limit dosage and duration of alprazolam during concomitant use with CNS depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Examples Psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, ethanol, and other drugs which themselves produce CNS depression. Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A (except ritonavir) Clinical implication Concomitant use of alprazolam with strong CYP3A inhibitors has a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam, resulting in increased concentrations of alprazolam and increased risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Prevention or management Concomitant use of alprazolam with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (except ritonavir) is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Examples Ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin Moderate or Weak Inhibitors of CYP3A Clinical implication Concomitant use of alprazolam with CYP3A inhibitors may increase the concentrations of alprazolam, resulting in increased risk of adverse reactions of alprazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Prevention or management Avoid use and consider appropriate dose reduction when alprazolam is coadministered with a moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Examples Nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, erythromycin CYP3A Inducers Clinical implication Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers can increase alprazolam metabolism and therefore can decease plasma levels of alprazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prevention or management Caution is recommended during coadministration with alprazolam. Examples Carbamazepine, phenytoin Ritonavir Clinical implication Interactions involving ritonavir and alprazolam are complex and time dependent. Short term administration of ritonavir increased alprazolam exposure due to CYP3A4 inhibition. Following long term treatment of ritonavir (>10 to 14 days), CYP3A4 induction offsets this inhibition. Alprazolam exposure was not meaningfully affected in the presence of ritonavir. Prevention or management Reduce alprazolam dosage when ritonavir and alprazolam are initiated concomitantly, or when ritonavir is added to a regimen where alprazolam is stabilized. Increase alprazolam dosage to the target dosage after 10 to 14 days of dosing ritonavir and alprazolam concomitantly. No dosage adjustment of alprazolam is necessary in patients receiving ritonavir for more than 10 to14 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Concomitant use of alprazolam with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, except ritonavir, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Digoxin Clinical implication Increased digoxin concentrations have been reported when alprazolam was given, especially in geriatric patients (>65 years of age). Prevention or management In patients on digoxin therapy, measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating alprazolam. Continue monitoring digoxin serum concentration and toxicity frequently . Reduce the digoxin dose if necessary. 7.2 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Although interactions between benzodiazepines and commonly employed clinical laboratory tests have occasionally been reported, there is no consistent pattern for a specific drug or specific test.\"\n",

( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to psychiatric medications, including alprazolam, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/ . Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Clinical Considerations)]. Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Data Human Data Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco, and other medications, have not confirmed these findings. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from published literature reports the presence of alprazolam in human breast milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. The effects of alprazolam on lactation are unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in breastfed infants, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with alprazolam. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of alprazolam have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Alprazolam-treated geriatric patients had higher plasma concentrations of alprazolam (due to reduced clearance) compared to younger adult patients receiving the same doses. Therefore, dosage reduction of alprazolam is recommended in geriatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Patients with alcoholic liver disease exhibit a longer elimination half-life (19.7 hours), compared to healthy subjects (11.4 hours). This may be caused by decreased clearance of alprazolam in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Dosage reduction of alprazolam is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .\"\n",

Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo. The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol). 9.3 Dependence Alprazolam may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Acute Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures, and suicidality. Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome Protracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used. Tolerance Tolerance to alprazolam may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of alprazolam may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.\"\n",

            "        \"10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage. In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage.

            "        \"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Alprazolam is a 1,4 benzodiazepine. Alprazolam exerts its effect for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder through binding to the benzodiazepine site of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA A ) receptors in the brain and enhances GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma levels of alprazolam increase proportionally to the dose over the range of 0.5 to 3 mg. Absorption Following oral administration, peak plasma concentration of alprazolam (C max ) occurs in 1 to 2 hours post dose. Distribution Alprazolam is 80% bound to human serum protein, and albumin accounts for the majority of the binding. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) of alprazolam is approximately 11.2 hours (range: 6.3 to 26.9 hours) in healthy adults. Metabolism Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), to 2 major active metabolites in the plasma: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and \\u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam. The plasma circulation levels of the two active metabolites are less than 4% of the parent. The reported relative potencies in benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments and in animal models of induced seizure inhibition are 0.20 and 0.66, respectively, for 4-hydroxyalprazolam and \\u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and \\u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they unlikely contribute much to the effects of alprazolam. A benzophenone derived from alprazolam is also found in humans. Their half-lives appear to be similar to that of alprazolam. Excretion Alprazolam and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The mean T 1/2 of alprazolam was 16.3 hours (range: 9.0 to 26.9 hours) in healthy elderly subjects compared to 11.0 hours (range: 6.3 to 15.8 hours, n=16) in healthy younger adult subjects. Obese Patients The mean T 1/2 of alprazolam was 21.8 hours (range: 9.9 to 40.4 hours) in a group of obese subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The mean T 1/2 of alprazolam was 19.7 hours (range: 5.8 to 65.3 hours) in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Racial or Ethnic Groups Maximal concentrations and T 1/2 of alprazolam are approximately 15% and 25% higher in Asians compared to Caucasians. Smoking Alprazolam concentrations may be reduced by up to 50% in smokers compared to non-smokers. Drug Interaction Studies In Vivo Studies Most of the interactions that have been documented with alprazolam are with drugs that modulate CYP3A4 activity. Compounds that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A would be expected to increase or decrease plasma alprazolam concentrations, respectively. Drug products that have been studied in vivo , along with their effect on increasing alprazolam AUC, are as follows: ketoconazole, 3.98 fold; itraconazole, 2.66 fold; nefazodone, 1.98 fold; fluvoxamine, 1.96 fold; and erythromycin, 1.61 fold [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Other studied drugs include: Cimetidine : Coadministration of cimetidine increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 82%, decreased clearance by 42%, and increased T 1/2 by 16%. Fluoxetine : Coadministration of fluoxetine with alprazolam increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 46%, decreased clearance by 21%, increased T 1/2 by 17%, and decreased measured psychomotor performance. Oral Contraceptives : Coadministration of oral contraceptives increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 18%, decreased clearance by 22%, and increased T 1/2 by 29%. Carbamazepine : The oral clearance of alprazolam (given in a 0.8 mg single dose) was increased from 0.90\\u00b10.21 mL/min/kg to 2.13\\u00b10.54 mL/min/kg and the elimination T 1/2 was shortened (from 17.1\\u00b14.9 to 7.7\\u00b11.7 hour) following administration of 300 mg per day carbamazepine for 10 days [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . However, the carbamazepine dose used in this study was fairly low compared to the recommended doses (1000 to 1200 mg per day); the effect at usual carbamazepine doses is unknown. Ritonavir : Interactions involving HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) and alprazolam are complex and time dependent. Short-term low doses of ritonavir (4 doses of 200 mg) increased mean AUC of alprazolam by about 2.5-fold, and did not significantly affect C max of alprazolam. The elimination T 1/2 was prolonged (30 hours versus 13 hours). However, upon extended exposure to ritonavir (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days), CYP3A induction offset this inhibition. Alprazolam AUC and C max was reduced by 12% and 16%, respectively, in the presence of ritonavir. The elimination T 1/2 of alprazolam was not significantly changed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Sertraline : A single dose of alprazolam 1 mg and steady state dose of sertraline (50 mg to 150 mg per day) did not reveal any clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam. Imipramine and Desipramine : The steady state plasma concentrations of imipramine and desipramine have been reported to be increased an average of 31% and 20%, respectively, by the concomitant administration of alprazolam in doses up to 4 mg per day. Warfarin : Alprazolam did not affect the prothrombin or plasma warfarin levels in male volunteers administered sodium warfarin orally. In Vitro Studies Data from in vitro studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction of alprazolam with paroxetine. The ability of alprazolam to induce human hepatic enzyme systems has not yet been determined.\"\n",

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation when alprazolam is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction Inform patients that the use of alprazolam, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2) ] . Withdrawal Reactions Inform patients that the continued use of alprazolam may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of alprazolam may require a slow taper [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . Effects on Driving and Operating Machinery Advise patients not to drive a motor vehicle or operate heavy machinery while taking alprazolam due to its CNS depressant effects. Also advise patients to avoid use of alcohol or other CNS depressants while taking alprazolam [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Patients with Depression Advise patients, their families, and caregivers to look for signs of suicidality or worsening depression, and to inform the patient\\u2019s healthcare provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Concomitant Medications Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of all medicines they take, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins and herbal supplements [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Alprazolam tablets are a benzodiazepine medicine. Taking benzodiazepines with opioid medicines, alcohol, or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (including street drugs) can cause severe drowsiness, breathing problems (respiratory depression), coma and death. Get emergency help right away if any of the following happens: shallow or slowed breathing breathing stops (which may lead to the heart stopping) excessive sleepiness (sedation) Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how taking alprazolam tablets with opioids affects you. Risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction. There is a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction with benzodiazepines, including alprazolam tablets, which can lead to overdose and serious side effects including coma and death. Serious side effects including coma and death have happened in people who have abused or misused benzodiazepines, including alprazolam tablets. These serious side effects may also include delirium, paranoia, suicidal thoughts or actions, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these serious side effects. You can develop an addiction even if you take alprazolam tablets as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Take alprazolam tablets exactly as your healthcare provider prescribed. Do not share your alprazolam tablets with other people. Keep alprazolam tablets in a safe place and away from children. Physical dependence and withdrawal reactions . Alprazolam tablets can cause physical dependence and withdrawal reactions. Do not suddenly stop taking alprazolam tablets . Stopping alprazolam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms. Some people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines, have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months , including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not take more alprazolam tablets than prescribed or take alprazolam tablets for longer than prescribed. What are alprazolam tablets? Alprazolam tablets are a prescription medicine used: to treat anxiety disorders for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety to treat panic disorder with or without a fear of places and situations that might cause panic, helplessness, or embarrassment (agoraphobia) Alprazolam tablets are a federal controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains alprazolam that can be abused or lead to dependence. Keep alprazolam tablets in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. Selling or giving away alprazolam tablets may harm others, and is against the law.

            "        \"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy : In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with rabeprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing ( 5.1 ). Use with Warfarin : Monitor for increases in INR and prothrombin time ( 5.2 , 7 ). Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis : Discontinue treatment and evaluate patients ( 5.3 ). Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of ( 5.4 ). Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine ( 5.5 ). Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous, new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and refer to specialist for evaluation ( 5.6 ). Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency : Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin ( 5.7 ). Hypomagnesemia : Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs ( 5.8 ). Interaction with Methotrexate : Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets ( 5.9 , 7 ). Fundic Gland Polyps : Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Use the shortest duration of therapy ( 5.10 ). 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. 5.2 Interaction with Warfarin Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and warfarin have not been adequately evaluated in patients. There have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.3 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.4 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, refer to Warnings and Precautions sections of the corresponding prescribing information. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies in adults suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including rabeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.7 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo - or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets. 5.8 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.9 Interaction with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information ) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.10 Fundic Gland Polyps PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.\"\n",

Most common adverse reactions in adolescents (\\u22652%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd, at 888-413-0949 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults The data described below reflect exposure to Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets in 1064 adult patients exposed for up to 8 weeks. The studies were primarily placebo- and active-controlled trials in adult patients with Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Duodenal Ulcers and Gastric Ulcers. The population had a mean age of 53 years (range 18-89 years) and had a ratio of approximately 60% male: 40% female. The racial distribution was 86% Caucasian, 8% African American, 2% Asian, and 5% other. Most patients received either 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg per day of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets. An analysis of adverse reactions appearing in \\u22652% of patients treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets (n=1064) and with a greater frequency than placebo (n=89) in controlled North American and European acute treatment trials, revealed the following adverse reactions: pain (3% vs. 1%), pharyngitis (3% vs. 2%), flatulence (3% vs. 1%), infection (2% vs. 1%), and constipation (2% vs. 1%). Three long-term maintenance studies consisted of a total of 740 adult patients; at least 54% of adult patients were exposed to Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets for 6 months and at least 33% were exposed for 12 months. Of the 740 adult patients, 247 (33%) and 241 (33%) patients received 10 mg and 20 mg of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, respectively, while 169 (23%) patients received placebo and 83 (11%) received omeprazole. The safety profile of rabeprazole in the maintenance studies in adults was consistent with what was observed in the acute studies. Less common adverse reactions seen in controlled clinical trials (<2% of patients treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and greater than placebo) and for which there is a possibility of a causal relationship to rabeprazole, include the following: headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dizziness, peripheral edema, hepatic enzyme increase, hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, myalgia, and arthralgia. Combination Treatment with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin: In clinical trials using combination therapy with rabeprazole plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin (RAC), no adverse reactions unique to this drug combination were observed. In the U.S. multicenter study, the most frequently reported drug related adverse reactions for patients who received RAC therapy for 7 or 10 days were diarrhea (8% and 7%) and taste perversion (6% and 10%), respectively. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities particular to the drug combinations were observed. For more information on adverse reactions or laboratory changes with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their respective prescribing information, Adverse Reactions section. Pediatrics In a multicenter, open-label study of adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD or endoscopically proven GERD, the adverse event profile was similar to that of adults. The adverse reactions reported without regard to relationship to Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets that occurred in \\u22652% of 111 patients were headache (9.9%), diarrhea (4.5%), nausea (4.5%), vomiting (3.6%), and abdominal pain (3.6%). The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in \\u22652% of patients were headache (5.4%) and nausea (1.8%). There were no adverse reactions reported in this study that were not previously observed in adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of rabeprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: vertigo Eye Disorders: blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders: fundic gland polyps General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: sudden death Hepatobiliary Disorders: jaundice Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis, angioedema, systemic lupus erythematosus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea Investigations: Increases in prothrombin time/INR (in patients treated with concomitant warfarin), TSH elevations Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hyperammonemia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal System Disorders: bone fracture, rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders: coma Psychiatric Disorders: delirium, disorientation Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: interstitial pneumonia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions including bullous and other drug eruptions of the skin, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, erythema multiforme\"\n",

            "        \"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 2 includes drugs with clinically important drug interactions and interaction with diagnostics when administered concomitantly with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and instructions for preventing or managing them. Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with PPIs. Table 2: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets and Interactions with Diagnostics Antiretrovirals Clinical Impact: The effect of PPI on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with rabeprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance. Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with rabeprazole may increase toxicity. There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with rabeprazole. Intervention: Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . See prescribing information. Atazanavir: See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information. Nelfinavir: Avoid concomitant use with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets. See prescribing information for nelfinavir. Saquinavir: See the prescribing information for saquinavir and monitor for potential saquinavir toxicities. Other antiretrovirals: See prescribing information. Warfarin Clinical Impact: Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs, including rabeprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Intervention: Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. See prescribing information for warfarin. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of rabeprazole with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Intervention: A temporary withdrawal of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets may be considered in some patients receiving high dose methotrexate administration. Digoxin Clinical Impact: Potential for increased exposure of digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: Monitor digoxin concentrations. Dose adjustment of digoxin may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for digoxin. Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole, itraconazole) Clinical Impact: Rabeprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity. Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and MMF. Use Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF. See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions, including potentially fatal arrhythmias, and are contraindicated. Amoxicillin also has drug interactions. Intervention: See Contraindications and Warnings and Precautions in prescribing information for clarithromycin. See Drug Interactions in prescribing information for amoxicillin. Tacrolimus Clinical Impact: Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19. Intervention: Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Dose adjustment of tacrolimus may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for tacrolimus. Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors Clinical Impact: Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Intervention: Temporarily stop Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary. Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test Clinical Impact: Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma. Intervention: Temporarily stop treatment with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets at least 14 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline. False Positive Urine Tests for THC Clinical Impact: There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs. Intervention: An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions ( 7 ).\"\n",

            "        \"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric use: Dosage strength not appropriate for patients less than 12 years ( 2 , 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available human data on Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform the drug associated risk. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. No evidence of adverse developmental effects were seen in animal reproduction studies with rabeprazole administered during organogenesis at 13 and 8 times the human area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) at the recommended dose for GERD, in rats and rabbits, respectively [see Data] . Changes in bone morphology were observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of a different PPI through most of pregnancy and lactation. When maternal administration was confined to gestation only, there were no effects on bone physeal morphology in the offspring at any age [see Data] . Data Animal Data Embryo-fetal developmental studies have been performed in rats during organogenesis at intravenous doses of rabeprazole up to 50 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 11.8 \\u03bcg\\u2022hr/mL, about 13 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 7.3 \\u03bcg\\u2022hr/mL, about 8 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to rabeprazole. Administration of rabeprazole to rats in late gestation and during lactation at an oral dose of 400 mg/kg/day (about 195-times the human oral dose based on mg/m 2 ) resulted in decreases in body weight gain of the pups. A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development was performed with a different PPI at about 3.4 to 57 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. Decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate, and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses of this PPI equal to or greater than 3.4 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. Physeal dysplasia in the femur was also observed in offspring after in utero and lactational exposure to the PPI at doses equal to or greater than 33.6 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. Effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in a pre- and postnatal toxicity study when the PPI was administered at oral doses of 3.4 to 57 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. When rats were dosed from gestational day 7 through weaning on postnatal day 21, a statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses equal to or greater than 33.6 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. A follow-up developmental toxicity study in rats with further time points to evaluate pup bone development from postnatal day 2 to adulthood was performed with a different PPI at oral doses of 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis) where drug administration was from either gestational day 7 or gestational day 16 until parturition. When maternal administration was confined to gestation only, there were no effects on bone physeal morphology in the offspring at any age. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Lactation studies have not been conducted to assess the presence of rabeprazole in human milk, the effects of rabeprazole on the breastfed infant, or the effects of rabeprazole on milk production. Rabeprazole is present in rat milk. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets have been established in pediatric patients for adolescent patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of symptomatic GERD. Use of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets in this age group is supported by adequate and well controlled studies in adults and a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study in 111 adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age. Patients had a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD, or suspected or endoscopically proven GERD and were randomized to either 10 mg or 20 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. The adverse reaction profile in adolescent patients was similar to that of adults. The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in \\u22652% of patients were headache (5%) and nausea (2%). There were no adverse reactions reported in these studies that were not previously observed in adults. The safety and effectiveness of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients for: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD Maintenance of Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD Treatment of Symptomatic GERD Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Helicobacter pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Treatment of Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions, Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release 20 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age because the tablet strength exceeds the recommended dose for these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . For pediatric patients 1 year to less than 12 years of age consider another rabeprazole formulation. The safety and effectiveness of a different dosage form and dosage strength of rabeprazole has been established in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years for the treatment of GERD. Juvenile Animal Data Studies in juvenile and young adult rats and dogs were performed. In juvenile animal studies rabeprazole sodium was administered orally to rats for up to 5 weeks and to dogs for up to 13 weeks, each commencing on Day 7 post-partum and followed by a 13-week recovery period. Rats were dosed at 5, 25, or 150 mg/kg/day and dogs were dosed at 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day. The data from these studies were comparable to those reported for young adult animals. Pharmacologically mediated changes, including increased serum gastrin levels and stomach changes, were observed at all dose levels in both rats and dogs. These observations were reversible over the 13-week recovery periods. Although body weights and/or crown-rump lengths were minimally decreased during dosing, no effects on the development parameters were noted in either juvenile rats or dogs. When juvenile animals were treated for 28 days with a different PPI at doses equal to or greater than 34 times the daily oral human dose on a body surface area basis, overall growth was affected and treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, and decreases in femur weight and femur length were observed. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (n=2009) in clinical studies of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, 19% were 65 years and over, while 4% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Administration of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) resulted in increased exposure and decreased elimination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no information in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Avoid use of Rabeprazole Sodum delayed-release tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment; however, if treatment is necessary, monitor patients for adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] .\"\n",

            "        \"11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets is rabeprazole sodium, which is a proton pump inhibitor. It is a substituted benzimidazole known chemically as 2-[[[4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl]-methyl]sulfinyl]-1 H \\u2013benzimidazole sodium salt. It has an empirical formula of C 18 H 20 N 3 NaO 3 S and a molecular weight of 381.42. Rabeprazole sodium is an off white to yellowish white powder. It is very soluble in water and methanol, freely soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and ethyl acetate and insoluble in ether and n-hexane. The stability of rabeprazole sodium is a function of pH; it is rapidly degraded in acid media, and is more stable under alkaline conditions. The structural figure is: Figure1 Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets are available for oral administration as delayed-release, enteric-coated tablets containing 20 mg of rabeprazole sodium. Inactive ingredients of the 20 mg tablet are diacetylated monoglycerides, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose phthalate, light magnesium oxide, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, talc, and titanium dioxide.

            "        \"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Rabeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds (substituted benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitors) that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist properties, but suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H + , K + ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid secretion. In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide. When studied in vitro , rabeprazole is chemically activated at pH 1.2 with a half-life of 78 seconds. It inhibits acid transport in porcine gastric vesicles with a half-life of 90 seconds. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Antisecretory Activity The antisecretory effect begins within one hour after oral administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets. The median inhibitory effect of rabeprazole on 24 hour gastric acidity is 88% of maximal after the first dose. A 20 mg dose of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets inhibits basal and peptone meal-stimulated acid secretion versus placebo by 86% and 95%, respectively, and increases the percent of a 24-hour period that the gastric pH>3 from 10% to 65% (see table below) . This relatively prolonged pharmacodynamic action compared to the short pharmacokinetic half-life (1 to 2 hours) reflects the sustained inactivation of the H + , K + ATPase. Table 3: Gastric Acid Parameters: Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets versus Placebo after 7 Days of Once Daily Dosing Parameter Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets (20 mg once daily) Placebo Basal Acid Output (mmol/hr) 0.4 (p<0.01 versus placebo) 2.8 Stimulated Acid Output (mmol/hr) 0.6 13.3 %Time Gastric pH>3 65 10 Compared to placebo, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, administered once daily for 7 days significantly decreased intragastric acidity with all doses for each of four meal-related intervals and the 24-hour time period overall. In this study, there were no statistically significant differences between doses; however, there was a significant dose-related decrease in intragastric acidity. The ability of rabeprazole to cause a dose-related decrease in mean intragastric acidity is illustrated below. Table 4: AUC Acidity (Mmol\\u2219Hr/L): Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets versus Placebo on Day 7 of Once Daily Dosing (Mean\\u00b1SD) AUC interval (hrs) Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets Placebo (N=24) 10 mg (N=24) 20 mg (N=24) 40 mg (N=24) 08:00\\u201313:00 19.6\\u00b121.5 (p<0.001 versus placebo) 12.9\\u00b123 7.6\\u00b114.7 91.1\\u00b139.7 13:00\\u201319:00 5.6\\u00b19.7 8.3\\u00b129.8 1.3\\u00b15.2 95.5\\u00b148.7 19:00\\u201322:00 0.1\\u00b10.1 0.1\\u00b10.06 0.0\\u00b10.02 11.9\\u00b112.5 22:00\\u201308:00 129.2\\u00b184 109.6\\u00b167.2 76.9\\u00b158.4 479.9\\u00b1165 AUC 0-24 hours 155.5\\u00b190.6 130.9\\u00b181 85.8\\u00b164.3 678.5\\u00b1216 After administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets once daily for eight days, the mean percent of time that gastric pH greater than 3 or gastric pH greater than 4 after a single dose (Day 1) and multiple doses (Day 8) was significantly greater than placebo (see table below) . The decrease in gastric acidity and the increase in gastric pH observed with 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets administered once daily for eight days were compared to the same parameters for placebo, as illustrated below: Table 5: Gastric Acid Parameters Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets Once Daily Dosing versus Placebo on Day 1 and Day 8 a No inferential statistics conducted for this parameter. b Gastric pH was measured every hour over a 24-hour period.

After seven days of treatment, the percentage of time that esophageal pH was less than 4 decreased from baselines of 24.7% for 20 mg and 23.7% for 40 mg, to 5.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Normalization of 24-hour intraesophageal acid exposure was correlated to gastric pH greater than 4 for at least 35% of the 24-hour period; this level was achieved in 90% of subjects receiving Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets 20 mg and in 100% of subjects receiving Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets 40 mg. With Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets 20 mg and 40 mg per day, significant effects on gastric and esophageal pH were noted after one day of treatment, and more pronounced after seven days of treatment. Effects on Serum Gastrin The median fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner in patients treated once daily with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets for up to eight weeks for ulcerative or erosive esophagitis and in patients treated for up to 52 weeks to prevent recurrence of disease. The group median values stayed within the normal range. In a group of subjects treated with 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets for 4 weeks a doubling of mean serum gastrin concentrations was observed. Approximately 35% of these treated subjects developed serum gastrin concentrations above the upper limit of normal. Effects on Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cells Increased serum gastrin secondary to antisecretory agents stimulates proliferation of gastric ECL cells which, over time, may result in ECL cell hyperplasia in rats and mice and gastric carcinoids in rats, especially in females [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . In over 400 patients treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets (10 or 20 mg) once daily for up to one year, the incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose, which is consistent with the pharmacological action of the proton-pump inhibitor. No patient developed the adenomatoid, dysplastic or neoplastic changes of ECL cells in the gastric mucosa. No patient developed the carcinoid tumors observed in rats. Endocrine Effects Studies in humans for up to one year have not revealed clinically significant effects on the endocrine system. In healthy male subjects treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets for 13 days, no clinically relevant changes have been detected in the following endocrine parameters examined: 17\\u03b2-estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroxine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin, somatotrophic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisol-binding globulin, and urinary 6\\u03b2-hydroxycortisol, serum testosterone and circadian cortisol profile. Other Effects In humans treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets for up to one year, no systemic effects have been observed on the central nervous, lymphoid, hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems. No data are available on long-term treatment with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and ocular effects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of rabeprazole occur over a range of 2 to 5 hours (T max ). The rabeprazole C max and AUC are linear over an oral dose range of 10 mg to 40 mg. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 40 mg are administered every 24 hours; the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole is not altered by multiple dosing. Absorption Absolute bioavailability for a 20 mg oral tablet of rabeprazole (compared to intravenous administration) is approximately 52%. When Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets are administered with a high fat meal, T max is variable; which concomitant food intake may delay the absorption up to 4 hours or longer. However, the C max and the extent of rabeprazole absorption (AUC) are not significantly altered. Thus Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals. Distribution Rabeprazole is 96.3% bound to human plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism: Rabeprazole is extensively metabolized. A significant portion of rabeprazole is metabolized via systemic nonenzymatic reduction to a thioether compound. Rabeprazole is also metabolized to sulphone and desmethyl compounds via cytochrome P450 in the liver. The thioether and sulphone are the primary metabolites measured in human plasma. These metabolites were not observed to have significant antisecretory activity. In vitro studies have demonstrated that rabeprazole is metabolized in the liver primarily by cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A) to a sulphone metabolite and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to desmethyl rabeprazole. CYP2C19 exhibits a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3 to 5% of Caucasians and 17 to 20% of Asians). Rabeprazole metabolism is slow in these sub-populations, therefore, they are referred to as poor metabolizers of the drug. Excretion: Following a single 20 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled rabeprazole, approximately 90% of the drug was eliminated in the urine, primarily as thioether carboxylic acid; its glucuronide, and mercapturic acid metabolites. The remainder of the dose was recovered in the feces. Total recovery of radioactivity was 99.8%. No unchanged rabeprazole was recovered in the urine or feces. Specific Populations Geriatric Population: In 20 healthy elderly subjects administered 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets once daily for seven days, AUC values approximately doubled and the C max increased by 60% compared to values in a parallel younger control group. There was no evidence of drug accumulation after once daily administration [see Use in Specific Population (8.5) ] . Pediatric Population: The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole was studied in 12 adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age, in a multicenter study. Patients received 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets once daily for five or seven days. An approximate 40% increase in rabeprazole exposure was noted following 5 to 7 days of dosing compared with the exposure after 1 day dosing. Pharmacokinetic parameters in adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age were within the range observed in healthy adult subjects. Male and Female Patients and Race/ or Ethnic Groups : In analyses adjusted for body mass and height, rabeprazole pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences between male and female subjects. In studies that used different formulations of rabeprazole, AUC 0-\\u221e values for healthy Japanese men were approximately 50 to 60% greater than values derived from pooled data from healthy men in the United States. Patients with Renal Impairment: In 10 patients with stable end-stage renal disease requiring maintenance hemodialysis (creatinine clearance \\u22645 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), no clinically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole after a single 20 mg dose of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets when compared to 10 healthy subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In a single dose study of 10 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) who were administered a single 20 mg dose of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, AUC 0-24 was approximately doubled, the elimination half-life was 2- to 3-fold higher, and total body clearance was decreased to less than half compared to values in healthy men. In a multiple dose study of 12 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment administered 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodum delayed-release tablets once daily for eight days, AUC 0-\\u221e and C max values increased approximately 20% compared to values in healthy age- and gender-matched subjects. These increases were not statistically significant. No information exists on rabeprazole disposition in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Combined Administration with Antimicrobials: Sixteen healthy subjects genotyped as extensive metabolizers with respect to CYP2C19 were given 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, 1000 mg amoxicillin, 500 mg clarithromycin, or all 3 drugs in a four-way crossover study. Each of the four regimens was administered twice daily for 6 days. The AUC and C max for clarithromycin and amoxicillin were not different following combined administration compared to values following single administration. However, the rabeprazole AUC and C max increased by 11% and 34%, respectively, following combined administration. The AUC and C max for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin (active metabolite of clarithromycin) also increased by 42% and 46%, respectively. This increase in exposure to rabeprazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not expected to produce safety concerns. Effects of Other Drugs on Rabeprazole Antacids: Co-administration of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and antacids produced no clinically relevant changes in plasma rabeprazole concentrations. Effects of Rabeprazole on Other Drugs Studies in healthy subjects have shown that rabeprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP450 system, such as theophylline (CYP1A2) given as single oral doses, diazepam (CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) as a single intravenous dose, and phenytoin (CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) given as a single intravenous dose (with supplemental oral dosing). Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system have not been studied in patients. Clopidogrel: Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. A study of healthy subjects including CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers receiving once daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg concomitantly with placebo or with 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets (n=36), for 7 days was conducted. The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 12% (mean AUC ratio was 88%, with 90% CI of 81.7 to 95.5%) when Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets were coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Digoxin: In healthy adult subjects (n=16), co-administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets with 2.5 mg once daily doses of digoxin at steady state resulted in approximately 29% and 19% increase in mean C max and AUC (0-24) of digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Ketoconazole: In healthy adult subjects (n=19), co-administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets at steady state with a single 400 mg oral dose ketoconazole resulted in approximately an average of 31% reduction in both C max and AUC (0-inf) of ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Cyclosporine: In vitro incubations employing human liver microsomes indicated that rabeprazole inhibited cyclosporine metabolism with an IC 50 of 62 micromolar, a concentration that is over 50 times higher than the C max in healthy volunteers following 14 days of dosing with 20 mg of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets. This degree of inhibition is similar to that by omeprazole at equivalent concentrations. 12.4 Microbiology The following in vitro data are available but the clinical significance is unknown. Rabeprazole sodium, amoxicillin and clarithromycin as a three drug regimen has been shown to be active against most strains of Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) , Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Helicobacter pylori Susceptibility testing of H. pylori isolates was performed for amoxicillin and clarithromycin using agar dilution methodology 1 , and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Incidence of Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms Among Clinical Isolates Pretreatment Resistance: Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rate (MIC \\u22651 mcg/mL) to H. pylori was 9% (51/560) at baseline in all treatment groups combined. Greater than 99% (558/560) of patients had H. pylori isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC\\u22640.25 mcg/mL) to amoxicillin at baseline. Two patients had baseline H. pylori isolates with an amoxicillin MIC of 0.5 mcg/mL. For susceptibility testing information about Helicobacter pylori, see Microbiology section in prescribing information for clarithromycin and amoxicillin . Table 6: Clarithromycin Susceptibility Test Results and Clinical/Bacteriologic Outcomes a for a Three Drug Regimen (Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets 20 mg Twice Daily, Amoxicillin 1000 mg Twice Daily, and Clarithromycin 500 mg Twice Daily for 7 or 10 Days) a Includes only patients with pretreatment and post-treatment clarithromycin susceptibility test results. b Susceptible (S) MIC \\u2264 0.25 mcg/mL, Intermediate (I) MIC = 0.5 mcg/mL, Resistant (R) MIC \\u2265 1 mcg/mL Days of RAC Therapy Clarithromycin Pretreatment Results Total Number H. pylori Negative (Eradicated) H. pylori Positive (Persistent) Post-Treatment Susceptibility Results S b I b R b No MIC 7 Susceptible b 129 103 2 0 1 23 7 Intermediate b 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 Resistant b 16 5 2 1 4 4 10 Susceptible b 133 111 3 1 2 16 10 Intermediate b 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 Resistant b 9 1 0 0 5 3 Patients with persistent H.pylori infection following rabeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin therapy will likely have clarithromycin resistant clinical isolates. Therefore, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done when possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated or susceptibility testing is not possible, alternative antimicrobial therapy should be instituted. Amoxicillin Susceptibility Test Results and Clinical/Bacteriological Outcomes: In the U.S. multicenter study, greater than 99% (558/560) of patients had H. pylori isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC \\u2264 0.25 mcg/mL) to amoxicillin at baseline. The other 2 patients had baseline H. pylori isolates with an amoxicillin MIC of 0.5 mcg/mL, and both isolates were clarithromycin-resistant at baseline; in one case the H. pylori was eradicated. In the 7- and 10-day treatment groups 75% (107/145) and 79% (112/142), respectively, of the patients who had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs (\\u2264 0.25 mcg/mL) were eradicated of H. pylori . No patients developed amoxicillin-resistant H. pylori during therapy. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics In a clinical study in evaluating Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets in Japanese adult patients categorized by CYP2C19 genotype (n=6 per genotype category), gastric acid suppression was higher in poor metabolizers as compared to extensive metabolizers. This could be due to higher rabeprazole plasma levels in poor metabolizers. The clinical relevance of this is not known. Whether or not interactions of rabeprazole sodium with other drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 would be different between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers has not been studied.\"\n",

            "        \"12.1 Mechanism of Action Rabeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds (substituted benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitors) that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist properties, but suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H + , K + ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid secretion. In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide. When studied in vitro , rabeprazole is chemically activated at pH 1.2 with a half-life of 78 seconds. It inhibits acid transport in porcine gastric vesicles with a half-life of 90 seconds.\"\n",

            "        \"12.2 Pharmacodynamics Antisecretory Activity The antisecretory effect begins within one hour after oral administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets. The median inhibitory effect of rabeprazole on 24 hour gastric acidity is 88% of maximal after the first dose. A 20 mg dose of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets inhibits basal and peptone meal-stimulated acid secretion versus placebo by 86% and 95%, respectively, and increases the percent of a 24-hour period that the gastric pH>3 from 10% to 65% (see table below) . This relatively prolonged pharmacodynamic action compared to the short pharmacokinetic half-life (1 to 2 hours) reflects the sustained inactivation of the H + , K + ATPase. Table 3: Gastric Acid Parameters: Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets versus Placebo after 7 Days of Once Daily Dosing Parameter Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets (20 mg once daily) Placebo Basal Acid Output (mmol/hr) 0.4 (p<0.01 versus placebo) 2.8 Stimulated Acid Output (mmol/hr) 0.6 13.3 %Time Gastric pH>3 65 10 Compared to placebo, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, administered once daily for 7 days significantly decreased intragastric acidity with all doses for each of four meal-related intervals and the 24-hour time period overall. In this study, there were no statistically significant differences between doses; however, there was a significant dose-related decrease in intragastric acidity. The ability of rabeprazole to cause a dose-related decrease in mean intragastric acidity is illustrated below.

The decrease in gastric acidity and the increase in gastric pH observed with 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets administered once daily for eight days were compared to the same parameters for placebo, as illustrated below: Table 5: Gastric Acid Parameters Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets Once Daily Dosing versus Placebo on Day 1 and Day 8 a No inferential statistics conducted for this parameter. b Gastric pH was measured every hour over a 24-hour period.

After seven days of treatment, the percentage of time that esophageal pH was less than 4 decreased from baselines of 24.7% for 20 mg and 23.7% for 40 mg, to 5.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Normalization of 24-hour intraesophageal acid exposure was correlated to gastric pH greater than 4 for at least 35% of the 24-hour period; this level was achieved in 90% of subjects receiving Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets 20 mg and in 100% of subjects receiving Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets 40 mg. With Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets 20 mg and 40 mg per day, significant effects on gastric and esophageal pH were noted after one day of treatment, and more pronounced after seven days of treatment. Effects on Serum Gastrin The median fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner in patients treated once daily with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets for up to eight weeks for ulcerative or erosive esophagitis and in patients treated for up to 52 weeks to prevent recurrence of disease. The group median values stayed within the normal range. In a group of subjects treated with 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets for 4 weeks a doubling of mean serum gastrin concentrations was observed. Approximately 35% of these treated subjects developed serum gastrin concentrations above the upper limit of normal. Effects on Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cells Increased serum gastrin secondary to antisecretory agents stimulates proliferation of gastric ECL cells which, over time, may result in ECL cell hyperplasia in rats and mice and gastric carcinoids in rats, especially in females [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . In over 400 patients treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets (10 or 20 mg) once daily for up to one year, the incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose, which is consistent with the pharmacological action of the proton-pump inhibitor. No patient developed the adenomatoid, dysplastic or neoplastic changes of ECL cells in the gastric mucosa. No patient developed the carcinoid tumors observed in rats. Endocrine Effects Studies in humans for up to one year have not revealed clinically significant effects on the endocrine system. In healthy male subjects treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets for 13 days, no clinically relevant changes have been detected in the following endocrine parameters examined: 17\\u03b2-estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroxine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin, somatotrophic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisol-binding globulin, and urinary 6\\u03b2-hydroxycortisol, serum testosterone and circadian cortisol profile. Other Effects In humans treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets for up to one year, no systemic effects have been observed on the central nervous, lymphoid, hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems. No data are available on long-term treatment with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and ocular effects.\"\n",

            "        \"12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of rabeprazole occur over a range of 2 to 5 hours (T max ). The rabeprazole C max and AUC are linear over an oral dose range of 10 mg to 40 mg. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 40 mg are administered every 24 hours; the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole is not altered by multiple dosing. Absorption Absolute bioavailability for a 20 mg oral tablet of rabeprazole (compared to intravenous administration) is approximately 52%. When Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets are administered with a high fat meal, T max is variable; which concomitant food intake may delay the absorption up to 4 hours or longer. However, the C max and the extent of rabeprazole absorption (AUC) are not significantly altered. Thus Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals. Distribution Rabeprazole is 96.3% bound to human plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism: Rabeprazole is extensively metabolized. A significant portion of rabeprazole is metabolized via systemic nonenzymatic reduction to a thioether compound. Rabeprazole is also metabolized to sulphone and desmethyl compounds via cytochrome P450 in the liver. The thioether and sulphone are the primary metabolites measured in human plasma. These metabolites were not observed to have significant antisecretory activity. In vitro studies have demonstrated that rabeprazole is metabolized in the liver primarily by cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A) to a sulphone metabolite and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to desmethyl rabeprazole. CYP2C19 exhibits a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3 to 5% of Caucasians and 17 to 20% of Asians). Rabeprazole metabolism is slow in these sub-populations, therefore, they are referred to as poor metabolizers of the drug. Excretion: Following a single 20 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled rabeprazole, approximately 90% of the drug was eliminated in the urine, primarily as thioether carboxylic acid; its glucuronide, and mercapturic acid metabolites. The remainder of the dose was recovered in the feces. Total recovery of radioactivity was 99.8%. No unchanged rabeprazole was recovered in the urine or feces. Specific Populations Geriatric Population: In 20 healthy elderly subjects administered 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets once daily for seven days, AUC values approximately doubled and the C max increased by 60% compared to values in a parallel younger control group. There was no evidence of drug accumulation after once daily administration [see Use in Specific Population (8.5) ] . Pediatric Population: The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole was studied in 12 adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age, in a multicenter study. Patients received 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets once daily for five or seven days. An approximate 40% increase in rabeprazole exposure was noted following 5 to 7 days of dosing compared with the exposure after 1 day dosing. Pharmacokinetic parameters in adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age were within the range observed in healthy adult subjects. Male and Female Patients and Race/ or Ethnic Groups : In analyses adjusted for body mass and height, rabeprazole pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences between male and female subjects. In studies that used different formulations of rabeprazole, AUC 0-\\u221e values for healthy Japanese men were approximately 50 to 60% greater than values derived from pooled data from healthy men in the United States. Patients with Renal Impairment: In 10 patients with stable end-stage renal disease requiring maintenance hemodialysis (creatinine clearance \\u22645 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), no clinically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole after a single 20 mg dose of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets when compared to 10 healthy subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In a single dose study of 10 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) who were administered a single 20 mg dose of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, AUC 0-24 was approximately doubled, the elimination half-life was 2- to 3-fold higher, and total body clearance was decreased to less than half compared to values in healthy men. In a multiple dose study of 12 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment administered 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodum delayed-release tablets once daily for eight days, AUC 0-\\u221e and C max values increased approximately 20% compared to values in healthy age- and gender-matched subjects. These increases were not statistically significant. No information exists on rabeprazole disposition in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Combined Administration with Antimicrobials: Sixteen healthy subjects genotyped as extensive metabolizers with respect to CYP2C19 were given 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, 1000 mg amoxicillin, 500 mg clarithromycin, or all 3 drugs in a four-way crossover study. Each of the four regimens was administered twice daily for 6 days. The AUC and C max for clarithromycin and amoxicillin were not different following combined administration compared to values following single administration. However, the rabeprazole AUC and C max increased by 11% and 34%, respectively, following combined administration. The AUC and C max for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin (active metabolite of clarithromycin) also increased by 42% and 46%, respectively. This increase in exposure to rabeprazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not expected to produce safety concerns. Effects of Other Drugs on Rabeprazole Antacids: Co-administration of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and antacids produced no clinically relevant changes in plasma rabeprazole concentrations. Effects of Rabeprazole on Other Drugs Studies in healthy subjects have shown that rabeprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP450 system, such as theophylline (CYP1A2) given as single oral doses, diazepam (CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) as a single intravenous dose, and phenytoin (CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) given as a single intravenous dose (with supplemental oral dosing). Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system have not been studied in patients. Clopidogrel: Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. A study of healthy subjects including CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers receiving once daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg concomitantly with placebo or with 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets (n=36), for 7 days was conducted. The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 12% (mean AUC ratio was 88%, with 90% CI of 81.7 to 95.5%) when Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets were coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Digoxin: In healthy adult subjects (n=16), co-administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets with 2.5 mg once daily doses of digoxin at steady state resulted in approximately 29% and 19% increase in mean C max and AUC (0-24) of digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Ketoconazole: In healthy adult subjects (n=19), co-administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets at steady state with a single 400 mg oral dose ketoconazole resulted in approximately an average of 31% reduction in both C max and AUC (0-inf) of ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Cyclosporine: In vitro incubations employing human liver microsomes indicated that rabeprazole inhibited cyclosporine metabolism with an IC 50 of 62 micromolar, a concentration that is over 50 times higher than the C max in healthy volunteers following 14 days of dosing with 20 mg of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets. This degree of inhibition is similar to that by omeprazole at equivalent concentrations.\"\n",

Rabeprazole sodium, amoxicillin and clarithromycin as a three drug regimen has been shown to be active against most strains of Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) , Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Helicobacter pylori Susceptibility testing of H. pylori isolates was performed for amoxicillin and clarithromycin using agar dilution methodology 1 , and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Incidence of Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms Among Clinical Isolates Pretreatment Resistance: Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rate (MIC \\u22651 mcg/mL) to H. pylori was 9% (51/560) at baseline in all treatment groups combined. Greater than 99% (558/560) of patients had H. pylori isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC\\u22640.25 mcg/mL) to amoxicillin at baseline. Two patients had baseline H. pylori isolates with an amoxicillin MIC of 0.5 mcg/mL. For susceptibility testing information about Helicobacter pylori, see Microbiology section in prescribing information for clarithromycin and amoxicillin .

Therefore, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done when possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated or susceptibility testing is not possible, alternative antimicrobial therapy should be instituted. Amoxicillin Susceptibility Test Results and Clinical/Bacteriological Outcomes: In the U.S. multicenter study, greater than 99% (558/560) of patients had H. pylori isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC \\u2264 0.25 mcg/mL) to amoxicillin at baseline. The other 2 patients had baseline H. pylori isolates with an amoxicillin MIC of 0.5 mcg/mL, and both isolates were clarithromycin-resistant at baseline; in one case the H. pylori was eradicated. In the 7- and 10-day treatment groups 75% (107/145) and 79% (112/142), respectively, of the patients who had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs (\\u2264 0.25 mcg/mL) were eradicated of H. pylori . No patients developed amoxicillin-resistant H. pylori during therapy.\"\n",

            "        \"13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In an 88/104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, rabeprazole at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day did not produce any increased tumor occurrence. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to rabeprazole (AUC) of 1.40 \\u03bcg\\u2022hr/mL which is 1.6 times the human exposure (plasma AUC 0-\\u221e = 0.88 \\u03bcg\\u2022hr/mL) at the recommended dose for GERD (20 mg/day). In a 28-week carcinogenicity study in p53 +/- transgenic mice, rabeprazole at oral doses of 20, 60, and 200 mg/kg/day did not cause an increase in the incidence rates of tumors but produced gastric mucosal hyperplasia at all doses. The systemic exposure to rabeprazole at 200 mg/kg/day is about 17 to 24 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, males were treated with oral doses of 5, 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and females with 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg/day. Rabeprazole produced gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia in male and female rats and ECL cell carcinoid tumors in female rats at all doses including the lowest tested dose. The lowest dose (5 mg/kg/day) produced a systemic exposure to rabeprazole (AUC) of about 0.1 \\u03bcg\\u2022hr/mL which is about 0.1 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD. In male rats, no treatment related tumors were observed at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day producing a rabeprazole plasma exposure (AUC) of about 0.2 \\u03bcg\\u2022hr/mL (0.2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD). Rabeprazole was positive in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward gene mutation test, and the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/\\u2013) forward gene mutation test. Its demethylated-metabolite was also positive in the Ames test. Rabeprazole was negative in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell chromosome aberration test, the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, and the in vivo and ex vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) tests. Rabeprazole at intravenous doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 8.8 \\u03bcg\\u2022hr/mL, about 10 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.\"\n",

For this and all studies of GERD healing, only patients with GERD symptoms and at least grade 2 esophagitis (modified Hetzel-Dent grading scale) were eligible for entry. Endoscopic healing was defined as grade 0 or 1. Each rabeprazole dose was significantly superior to placebo in producing endoscopic healing after four and eight weeks of treatment. The percentage of patients demonstrating endoscopic healing was as follows: Table 7: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Percentage of Patients Healed Week Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets Placebo N=25 10 mg once daily N=27 20 mg once daily N=25 40 mg once daily N=26 4 63% (p<0.001 versus placebo) 56% 54% 0% 8 93% 84% 85% 12% In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg doses compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 regarding complete resolution of GERD heartburn frequency (p\\u22640.026). All Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets groups reported significantly greater rates of complete resolution of GERD daytime heartburn severity compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 (p\\u22640.036). Mean reductions from baseline in daily antacid dose were statistically significant for all Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets groups when compared to placebo at both Weeks 4 and 8 (p\\u22640.007). In a North American multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study of 336 patients, the percentage of patients healed at endoscopy after four and eight weeks of treatment was statistically superior in the patients treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets compared to ranitidine: Table 8: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Percentage of Patients Healed Week 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets once daily N=167 Ranitidine 150 mg four times daily N=169 4 59% (p<0.001 versus ranitidine) 36% 8 87% 66% A dose of 20 mg once daily of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets was significantly more effective than ranitidine 150 mg four times daily in the percentage of patients with complete resolution of heartburn at Weeks 4 and 8 (p<0.001). Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets was also more effective in complete resolution of daytime heartburn (p\\u22640.025), and nighttime heartburn (p\\u22640.012) at both Weeks 4 and 8, with significant differences by the end of the first week of the study. The recommended dosage of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 to 8 weeks. 14.2 Long-Term Maintenance of Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD in Adults The long-term maintenance of healing in patients with erosive or ulcerative GERD previously healed with gastric antisecretory therapy was assessed in two U.S., multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of identical design of 52 weeks duration. The two studies randomized 209 and 285 patients, respectively, to receive either 10 mg or 20 mg of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets once daily or placebo. As demonstrated in Tables 9 and 10 below, patients treated with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets were significantly superior to placebo in both studies with respect to the maintenance of healing of GERD and the proportions of patients remaining free of heartburn symptoms at 52 weeks. The recommended dosage of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily.

Patients reported 5 or more periods of moderate to very severe heartburn during the placebo treatment phase the week prior to randomization. Patients were confirmed by endoscopy to have no esophageal erosions. The percentage of heartburn free daytime and/or nighttime periods was greater with 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets compared to placebo over the 4 weeks of study in Study RAB-USA-2 (47% vs. 23%) and Study RAB-USA-3 (52% vs. 28%). The mean decreases from baseline in average daytime and nighttime heartburn scores were significantly greater for Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets 20 mg as compared to placebo at week 4. Graphical displays depicting the daily mean daytime and nighttime scores are provided in Figures 2 to 5. In addition, the combined analysis of these two studies showed 20 mg of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets significantly improved other GERD-associated symptoms (regurgitation, belching, and early satiety) by week 4 compared with placebo (all p values < 0.005). A dose of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets also significantly reduced daily antacid consumption versus placebo over 4 weeks (p<0.001). The recommended dosage of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks.

Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets were significantly superior to placebo in producing healing of duodenal ulcers. The percentages of patients with endoscopic healing are presented below: Table 11: Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Percentage of Patients Healed Week Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets Placebo N=33 20 mg once daily N=34 40 mg once daily N=33 2 44% 42% 21% 4 79% p\\u22640.001 versus placebo 91% 39% At Weeks 2 and 4, significantly more patients in the Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets 20 and 40 mg groups reported complete resolution of ulcer pain frequency (p\\u22640.018), daytime pain severity (p\\u22640.023), and nighttime pain severity (p\\u22640.035) compared with placebo patients. The only exception was the 40 mg group versus placebo at Week 2 for duodenal ulcer pain frequency (p=0.094). Significant differences in resolution of daytime and nighttime pain were noted in both Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets groups relative to placebo by the end of the first week of the study. Significant reductions in daily antacid use were also noted in both Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets groups compared to placebo at Weeks 2 and 4 (p<0.001). An international randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial was conducted in 205 patients comparing 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets once daily with 20 mg omeprazole once daily. The study was designed to provide at least 80% power to exclude a difference of at least 10% between Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and omeprazole, assuming four-week healing response rates of 93% for both groups. In patients with endoscopically defined duodenal ulcers treated for up to four weeks, Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets were comparable to omeprazole in producing healing of duodenal ulcers. The percentages of patients with endoscopic healing at two and four weeks are presented below: Table 12: Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Percentage of Patients Healed Week Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets 20 mg once daily N=102 Omeprazole 20 mg once daily N=103 95% Confidence Interval for the Treatment Difference (Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets - Omeprazole) 2 69% 61% (\\u20136%, 22%) 4 98% 93% (\\u20133%, 15%) Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets and omeprazole were comparable in providing complete resolution of symptoms. The recommended dosage of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks. 14.5 Helicobacter pylori Eradication in Patients with Peptic Ulcer Disease or Symptomatic Non-Ulcer Disease in Adults The U.S. multicenter study was a double-blind, parallel-group comparison of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 3, 7, or 10 days vs. omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 10 days. Therapy consisted of rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (RAC) or omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (OAC). Patients with H. pylori infection were stratified in a 1:1 ratio for those with peptic ulcer disease (active or a history of ulcer in the past five years) [PUD] and those who were symptomatic but without peptic ulcer disease [NPUD], as determined by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The overall H.pylori eradication rates, defined as negative 13 C-UBT for H. pylori \\u2265 6 weeks from the end of the treatment are shown in the following table. The eradication rates in the 7-day and 10-day RAC regimens were found to be similar to 10-day OAC regimen using either the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) or Per-Protocol (PP) populations. Eradication rates in the RAC 3-day regimen were inferior to the other regimens. a Patients were included in the analysis if they had H. pylori infection documented at baseline, defined as a positive 13 C-UBT plus rapid urease test or culture and were not protocol violators. Patients who dropped out of the study due to an adverse event related to the study drug were included in the evaluable analysis as failures of therapy. b Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline as defined above and took at least one dose of study medication. All dropouts were included as failures of therapy. Table 13: Helicobacter pylori Eradication at \\u22656 Weeks After the End of Treatment Treatment Group Percent (%) of Patients Cured (Number of Patients) Difference (RAC - OAC) [95% Confidence Interval] 7-day RAC The 95% confidence intervals for the difference in eradication rates for 7-day RAC minus 10-day RAC are (- 9.3, 6.0) in the PP population and (-9.0, 7.5) in the ITT population. 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 84.3% (N=166) 81.6% (N=179) 2.8 [- 5.2, 10.7] Intent-to-Treat b 77.3% (N=194) 73.3% (N=206) 4.0 [- 4.4, 12.5] 10-day RAC 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 86.0% (N=171) 81.6% (N=179) 4.4 [- 3.3, 12.1] Intent-to-Treat b 78.1% (N=196) 73.3% (N=206) 4.8 [- 3.6, 13.2] 3-day RAC 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 29.9% (N=167) 81.6% (N=179) - 51.6 [- 60.6, - 42.6] Intent-to-Treat b 27.3% (N=187) 73.3% (N=206) - 46.0 [- 54.8, - 37.2] The recommended dosage of Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets is 20 mg twice daily with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 7 days. 14.6 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions, Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome in Adults Twelve patients with idiopathic gastric hypersecretion or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been treated successfully with Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets at doses from 20 to 120 mg for up to 12 months. Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets produced satisfactory inhibition of gastric acid secretion in all patients and complete resolution of signs and symptoms of acid-peptic disease where present. Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets also prevented recurrence of gastric hypersecretion and manifestations of acid-peptic disease in all patients. The high doses of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets used to treat this small cohort of patients with gastric hypersecretion were well tolerated. The recommended starting dosage of Rabeprazole Sodium delayed-release tablets is 60 mg once daily.\"\n",
